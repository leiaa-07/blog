### STEREOGRAMS ARE SOOO COOOOOOOLLLL UGHHHHHH

basically stereograms (or magic eyes) are those images that show up as 3d if u focus ur eyes in a certain way. example:

![example of stereogram](/static/images/blogs/stereogram-1.jpg)

im telling ya rn, if uve nvr seen these or tried these before, PLEASE. U HAVEEEE TO SEE THEM AT LEAST ONCE IN UR LIFE ‚ÄºÔ∏è just believe me, words cant even describe how awesome they look, u absolutely have to see it for urself aaa üò≠ (promise me u'll try them after reading this post okay :>)

i was first introduced to them by my dad like years ago, and we used to search up these magic eye imgs on our phones at night and try to see them, and i swear we'd look so crazy holding up our phone to our eyes and being like "THERES A BIRD THERES A BIRD" while staring at a completely random image that clearly didnt contain a bird HAHAHAH yea then last night, i saw a colour illusion while on my phone (those things where theyre the same colour but it doesn't look like it cuz of the colours surrounding it ykwim), and i was reminded of illusions and then suddenly rmbred the magic eye illusions which i completely forgot existed for YEARS. had to try one immediately and it took some time for me to see the img BUT IT'S STILL AS AMAZING AS THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT üò≠üíï

but i realised i nvr understood (1) how they work, and (2) HOW DOES ONE EVEN CREATE THEMMM??? yep so uhhhh look where we are now üòêüòê

### (1) some introduction ig

u can find a few of these magic eye illusions [here](https://www.magiceye.com/stwkdisp.htm). oh and heads up, when u click on the img, it "spoils" the illusion by showing u the img that ur supposed to see. aight basically, the way it works is that u gotta focus ur eyes in a certain way, and a 3d img will pop up right in front of you when u do it right. oh yea forgot to mention, but i recommend using ur phone, bigger devices arent rlly ideal. it takes some practice to finally get it but once u do, it's sooo worth it. just trust me, don't give up and keep trying until u see it huhu - basically u want ur eyes to be like this:
