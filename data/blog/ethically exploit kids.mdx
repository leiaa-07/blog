as wild as the title sounds, just HEAR ME OUTT okay

p.s. this write-up is sooo so long overdue cuz i started writing it like last year but forgot to finish it 💀

### (1) "but leia, WHY???!!"
here's the thing - young ppl are automatically ✨ special ✨ by default. legit if a kid had ANY sort of skill (no matter how mediocre), they'll be deemed "talented" by society. the bar for being impressive as a child is literally on the floor. a 5-year-old who can paint? WOWW TALENTED!! a 7-year-old who can sing? OMG SO TALENTED!! a 9-year-old who can play guitar? WHAAATT WOAHH PRODIGYYY!!! but a 40-year-old who can paint, sing AND play guitar?? YEA NO ONE CARES BOOOOO 👎🏻👎🏻 yea my point is that age and impressiveness are inversely proportional 🤓☝🏻. also similar to how many "gifted kids" grow up to become relatively normal and average people. sOoOoOo, while ur kids are in their "prime age", why would you NOT take advantage of that?? 😭🙏🏻

### (2) personal experience 
uh so when i was younger, i, like many other kids, had an ARTT phase 😱😱 (yeeeees yes how shocking that a math nerd once liked art 🙄) and i wasn't GREAT - like i could draw stuff sure? but it was decent at best. but in kindergarten (and like early primary sch ig), i actually sold some of my artworks yay. i presume bcs of encouragement from my parents lol. those ahem ahem "artworks" were literally just drawings of random stuff and then painted with water colour, and so i think i sold a few to my family members, each for like rm10 mybe LMAOOO. (okay that's not the impressive part yet to be clear.) oh ok ya for context, my mum also used to like to paint in her free time back then. so then when i was a bit older, around 9 to 11, idk how it happened but ig my mum's friends found out i could do art or smth, and so... they asked me to do paintings for them?? bro idk idr it tbh. uhm but here's the thing right, i did abstract paintings on a canvas okay - ABSTRACT. (also my mum def helped teach me painting techniques and stuff.) and tbh UMM... i just... campak the paint on the canvas la... 😐😐 no story, no interpretation, no symbolism, no ANYTHING. just dumb 10-year-old me throwing paint around HAHSNDNGG. even when my mum asked me "what do u wanna name this painting?", i legit didnt even know?? 😭😭 YEAA but then those paintings sold for QUITE A LOT okay 💀💀 and all my parents' friends were like "oMg leiA's oNLy tEnN bUt sOoO aRtiSTiC!! tHe XXX (insert some random reference to the totally random paint splashes) iS sUcHh a niCe tOuChHhH!! i wAnT hEr pAinTinGs in mY hOuSe tOoOo!!" AAADHSJDHAJ in the end, i only did a few la, but srsly i shdve done more or smth bcs it was such an easy way to get money?? AHAHAHAH dear god i hope none of my parents' friends ever see this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

### (3) so back to the WHY
bro u're only young once okay - meaning there's only a vry short period of ur life where u can completely suck at smth but have the world bow down to u for it just cuz u're a smol human 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ SO like while ur kids r kids and dk any better, WHY WOULD U NOT LEVERAGE THEIR AGEEE AAASHDJSADHSAJ. okok i sound like a terrible person ik but likeee i'd argue most kids wdnt mind/would enjoy it anyway, and what kid doesnt like money + praise thrown at them?? like HECK personally im rlly grateful my mum got me to sell paintings and i legit wish she got me to do it more 💀💀 so YES i would argue it's MORE than ethical okay

### (4) leia's ingeniously simple, very ethical, 99% foolproof money-making scheme™
finally we need to talk abt the HOW. i feel like every kid has an art phase at some point in their life so like

**STEP 1:** give ur kid canvas + paint and get them to do wtv they want wt it  
**STEP 2:** find a rich friend and befriend all rich friends of said rich friend  
**STEP 3:** casually mention to them ur kid is picasso, convince them ur kid is an artistic genius  
(optional step: kids r creative - get them to make up some interpretation of their art (or mybe they actually alry did hv one, tho i nvr did) and have them yap abt it to ur rich friends - it strengthens ur case)  
**STEP 4:** SELL. PROFIT. REPEAT. AND BE PREPARED TO GET RICHHHH 🤑🤑🤑💰💰

"but what if my kid NEVER has an art phase??? 😱😱😱" i mean first of all realistically theres only like a 10% chance of that happening. and even if ur kid never has an official art phase, i mean cmon what kid doesnt like making a mess (which is kinda what abstract art is)??? anything can be considered art, especially if a kid does it. mm but IF, by a slim chance, ur kid is totally abnormal, IDK bro figure it out, like it reaaally shdnt be that hard - i feel like anything can be monetised these days LMAOO. the key is finding rich ppl who believe kids r magical creatures and r willing to pay for ur kids COUHG COUGH "talent" (jkjk they might actually be talented). social media and competitions (w cash prizes ofc) r also an option but depending on who u ask, those r arguably less fun and less ethical lol (unless ur kid enjoys it laaa) - and also generally harder to profit i believe (weeeeelll it depends). yea figure it out man but if u ask me, i think my scheme is preeetty foolproof 😌😌💪🏻

leia's ingeniously simple, very ethical, 99% foolproof money-making scheme™ is classified as 99% foolproof, NOT 100%. results may vary based on rich friend availability and how convincingly ur kid can yap abt their art. no legal, financial or emotional liability will be accepted in the event of failure.
