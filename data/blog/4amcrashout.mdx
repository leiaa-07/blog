HELP im so stupid. so basically logging into ur mit acc requires 2FA thru this thing called duo. it's an app on my phone, and every time i try to log into my acc, i'll have to approve it thru the app la. pastu i recently got a new phone a few days ago, and baru je tadi installed duo (i was gonna sort that out, then sleep). tapi on my new phone my duo acc was disabled, and i cdnt figure out how to activate it at the time. then i thought "mybe sbb boleh link satu device je kut," so... i made the INSANELY STUPID mistake of uninstalling duo on my old phone, bcs i thought "well if i could set up duo the first time, then surely i can just set it up again. what's the worst that can happen??? 🤷🏻‍♀️😌" ha okay leia wtv la then aft that i realised how to activate my duo acc kat phone baru, but guess what?? doing that requires logging into my mit acc, WHICH requires duo authentication!! do i have duo authentication now?? NO. NO I DONT. BCS MY IDIOT SELF THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO DELETE THE DUO APP ON MY OLD PHONE DAMMIT. (and btw in case u're wondering - no, reinstalling on my old phone doesnt solve the issue, acc dah disabled.) SO NOW I CANT LOGIN TO ANY OF MY MIT ACCOUNTS. GREAT!!

dah email mit tadi and then they suggested some stuff (which im unable to do), so then they said hntr gmbr of urself + ID card (to verify identity) tapi i takde my ID card lagi sooo now i have to schedule a zoom meeting just so they can verify that AN IDIOT LIKE ME actually goes to mit 😭🙏🏻 AAAAJSJJD but they hvnt replied to my latest email (37 mins ago) yg i mintak for a zoom meeting SO LOWKEY STRESSING RN. ~~and idk i mean ik this is kinda a small stupid thing that can def be resolved, but i feel like i keep messing up and it feeds into my doubts that im not ready/dont deserve uni lmao~~ 💔💔

ALSO baru tadi UHM my laptop suddenly tak boleh charge?? like BRO genuinely scary but tetibe there were WHITE FUMES coming from the charging port (while it was charging, nasib baik i was there), and tempat dia charge tu (both laptop and charger) PANAS GILA. now my laptop wont charge and every time i try to, there's white fumes so UHMMMMMM heheh. oh ya and the charger kan, like the part that plugs into the laptop, IS SO DAMN FRIED. like it's all burnt and the plastic is melted 💀😭 help weh idk how to tell my parents AAAAA. IDK WHY IT'S LIKE THAT THO, DIA TIBA2 JE CAMTUUU. STRESS WEH BCS NOW I TAKUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT HABIS BATTERY AND I CAN NEVER SWITCH IT ON AGAIN. and my laptop doesnt support usb/type-c charging hahah im gonna cry

oh and kan i got a new phone (redmi bcs my family is very asian and we live for cheap china stuff WOOO 🤩💥), ya this is my first phone that's NOT a hand-me-down, and for some reason my mum thought it was a good idea to beli phone yg pretty slim and modern, but ngl i absolutely do NOT trust myself w this like fr kenapa tak beli nokia je OMG. legit im holding it in my hands rn pun it feels so fragile, like wow im typing so delicately and nak keyboard smash pun rasa cam kena gentle2 AHAHAHA i can totally foresee myself having a full-on crashout one day and keyboardsmashing so hard that my thumbs pierce thru the phone screen 🤠👍🏻 HA OMG ANOTHER THING. THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE A 3.5MM JACK (FOR EARPHONES) WEH. U HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD I LAUGHED (in pure disbelief) WHEN I FIRST TOOK A LOOK AT THE PHONE AND REALISED THERE'S NO 3.5MM JACK. HOW CAN THEY DO THAT WEH. HOW CAN A PHONE NOT HAVE A STANDARD EARPHONE JACK. PLS. IT'S LIKE WE'VE ADVANCED SO FAR THAT WE'VE ADVANCED BACKWARDS. HOWWW CAN A PHONE NOT HAVE A STANDARD EARPHONE JACK. DO THEY SRSLY EXPECT EVERYONE TO HAVE WIRELESS EARPHONES BCS SORRY BUT IVE BEEN LIVING OFF FREE EARPHONES THAT I GET FROM AEROPLANE FLIGHTS. AAAAAAJSJDJDMSKSKMDMFJDJDJFFN. ok i want to be clear that im not complaining abt my phone or anything, like im vry grateful for it, but i just think it's RIDICULOUS that a phone doesn't hv an earphone jack. anyway had to invest like rm12 in type-c earphones 🙄👎🏻

<small>**update from me in the morning aft a quick google search: DUDE WHAT THE HECK I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MOST PHONES NOWADAYS DON'T HAVE EARPHONE JACKS ANYMORE. APPLE STOPPED AT IPHONE 7 ALMOST 10 YEARS AGO??? BRO IM SORRY WHAT. WHY. HOW. MACAM MANA I BARU TAHU BENDA NI. BUT ALSO AAAAAHDJFJJGG WHYYYYYY UGH MANA BOLEH MACAM TUUUU 😭😭😭✋🏻✋🏻</small>

also i feel so ridiculously unprepared for uni but im actually gonna lose my mind if i start thinking abt it now and it's like 4.30am so i shd rlly sleep now so ya pls pray for my sanity- OH but today's gonna be a good day cuz ib results keluar and im sure i'll hear a lot of good news yay, mybe life will 📈📈 for a bit after all
