omg time and time again, i find myself in disbelief by the origin of brands, so now it's YOUR turn to be surprised muahaha 🫵🏻🫵🏻 ok so here's a little game: below i compiled a list of 40 brands, and ur task is to **guess whether or not the brand is local** (i.e. originates from msia). AND bonus, if u dont think it's from msia, guess the country of origin. once u make ur guess, click each of the dropdowns to reveal the answer

if u wish to keep track of ur score (ada poll kat bawah to see how u compare): gv urself +1 for each correct guess (i.e. msian/non-msian), but no bonus points for correctly guessing the origin for non-msian brands (takpe dpt ego boost dah cukup). HAHAHA aight glhf 😈😈

kinda obvious it's not msian but i was surprised (twice!! bcs i half-forgot after the first time i found out lol) that royce is **japanese** :00 then i rmbr saying to my parents smth along the lines of "wHy iS iT nOt rOiiSu?!?!" AHAHAHA and okay ya it actually IS "roizu" but they just englishified it and yea i think u'd agree w me that "royce" is not a vry japanese-looking word JDJDFJSJ. OH but it's interesting how they got the name: basically the founder's first name is yasuhiro. reverse the characters -> rohisuya, and "ya" is a suffix for shop in jpnese so that leaves rohisu -> roizu!! 🤯🤯

<details>
  <summary>35. darlie (toothpaste)</summary>

okay so yes u may hv been able to make the reasonable guess that darlie is, in fact, not msian. BUT would u have been able to guess its dark history... 💀💀 so once upon a time, the toothpaste was not called darlie but... darkie (a racial slur against african-americans) and featured a white man in blackface + a top hat. so ahh probably from the states (which was racially segregated at the time) right?? BUT SIKE NOPE ONCE AGAIN IT'S **CHINESE** 😭😭😭 and in chinese the toothpaste is (till today) called 黑人牙膏 (which directly translates to "black man toothpaste") AAAHSJDJF yea i think i learnt this info from one of my chinese friends. apparently the name is not rooted in racism tho but bcs ppl associated black ppl w white teeth (since their skin was dark, making their teeth look whiter). but later it became controversial in the US (*wow who wdve guessed!!*), so baru the english name was changed to darlie. HA THE MORE YOU KNOW 🌈✨
