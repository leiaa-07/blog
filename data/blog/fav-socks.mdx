okeh so ceritanya i need to pack for uni and ofc i need to pack my socks BUT HSJAJDHS HOW DO I EVEN CHOOSE??!! so yeah this is obvsly a VERY tough decision that i hv to make which must NOT, by any means, be taken lightly ☝🏻☝🏻 THEREFORE i hv decided to take a highly systematic, deeply scientific approach of evaluating a selected set of my fav socks so i can rank them + determine the top 10!! then from these, i'll probably only bring the top 6/7 (idk how many yet). HENCE, in my infinite sock wisdom, i have undertaken the noble task of thoughtfully and meticulously devising

## ✨ leia's double-A sock evaluation framework™ ✨

each sock will be evaluated on the following two criteria, rated out of 5:
1. **aesthetic** - how cool/awesome/cute does it look?
2. **attachment** - do i hv a personal connection w it? how sad would i be if i lost it?

<small>(i was initially gonna take comfort into account as well but i realised idc abt that AHAHAHAHAH)</small>

so yes without further ado... ladies and gentlemen... i present to u... my (current) top 10 favourite socks!! 😌🤘🏻

<small>⚠️ **disclaimer:** this ranking holds as of 12 aug 2025 but my preferences are extremely volatile and my indecisiveness absolutely does not help. i kid u not, if u ask me tmr, my ranking would probably be different lmao. also in reality all my socks r awesome (duh) so im rating a bit harshly 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️</small>

## #9 - GODMORGEN FOLKENS

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-denmark.jpg" alt="denmark" width="500"/>

**aesthetic: 1/5**  
look i dont mean to offend the entire country of denmark or anything BUT WE AGREE RIGHT? 😭😭🙏🏻 and also keep in mind my ratings r harsh so like 1/5 DOES NOT MEAN bad/ugly (i would give negative score if ugly), but just that it's definitely not like "OMG WOW CUTE SOCKS!!!" either, especially compared to other socks i own 😐🙃 and ALENA LITERALLY THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WINDOWS LOGO AND I DONT BLAME HER HAHAHAHAH

**attachment: 5/5**  
my danish friend maia from [mbl 2024](/blog/mbl%202024) gifted it to me when she came to visit 🥺🫶🏻 i also wore them for this year's kmc (instead of my usual math socks) but i performed BADDDHDJSA so i'd like to think it was cuz of these socks 💀💀

## #8 - CALBEE CHIPS YUM YUM

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-calbee.jpg" alt="calbee" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 4/5**  
oh these would be one hell of a conversation starter LMAO. lowkey seems like suhm WEIRD CURSED PROPAGANDA HSJBDHXDED 👹👹👹 then i'd hv to explain "oh!! it's just calbee chips!!" 😇😭👍🏻 kinda goofy to be wearing a japanese food brand on ur foot, but very quirky la lol

**attachment: 2.5/5**  
i bought them in japan bcss yaaa #QUIRKYY!! 😚😚✌🏻✌🏻 (i hate myself)

## #7 - SKWEEDWERDD

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-squidward.jpg" alt="squidward" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 4.5/5**  
HEHEH look at his derpy face i luv it :P. i rlly like the colours jugak. i think it looks better from my view than for others tho (bcs it's facing me), but it's squidward so like u rlly can't go wrong w these socks tbh 🤷🏻‍♀️😌

**attachment: 2/5**  
i mean i wear them quite a lot but i dont rlly hv a strong attachment w it. order online je so tak special pun

---

## #6 - CHOOWEEEEE

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-chewie.jpg" alt="chewie" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 4.5/5**  
cute and iconic and looks nice as a sock (as compared to my R2 or vader sock, for example) AND IT'S CHEWIEEEE 😍💯 tbh objectively i'd rate these a 4/5 je but dude i just KNOW the ppl there are gonna love the fact that a leia is wearing chewie socks

**attachment: 2/5**  
i wear them pretty frequently but idk, not that special besides the fact it's chewie. i bought them at some random store while waiting for my mum (always happens) i think

---

## #5 - KRABS VS PLANKTON

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-krabs-plankton.jpg" alt="krabs-plankton" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 5/5**  
ya these socks r not actually a pair btw but kalau plankton je or mr krabs je cam okay laa but kinda underwhelming. BUT COMBINE THE TWO AND OHHH MY GOODNESS I AM UNSTOPPABLE. and the way they're literally looking at each other?!?! like dude i am seriously the best matchmaker to ever exist omg. also their little feet r so cute!! :>

**attachment: 2/5**  
idk this duo is so dope ngl but i dont rlly hv any attachment to these socks. i think also sbb i technically hv two pairs of this duo HAHAHAH, so kalau hilang satu pun the other one still ada lol. also plankton was originally my brother's but i stole them hoorayy 😇👍🏻

<small>update from future me who is packing: BRUH HELP I CANT FIND THE OTHER PAIR AAAAAAAA. i'll search for them in the morning :(</small>

## #4 - ARTOOOO

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-r2.jpg" alt="r2" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 3.5/5**  
i mean it's R2 so OF COURSE it's cool but honestly a bit underwhelming and basic la. also i think the sock will just seem weird for ppl who dk R2 (but that's a malaysia issue fr 💔)

**attachment: 5/5**  
CERITANYA, i went to a star wars collectors market with alena (in 2023 i think) and we bought matching R2 socks there. TAPI ERM... at some point... one of the socks somehow went missing while doing laundry AAAJSJJDNF (biasa la kan) (idk if i ever told alena actually) and i guess my parents knew i was pretty sad abt that, so they bought me this new pair for my 16th birthday!! HAHAHAAH

## #3 - NERD ALERTTT

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-math.jpg" alt="math" width="500"/> 

**aesthetic: 4.99/5**  
i WOULD give it a 5/5 (for very obvious reasons amirite!! :D) but the only reason im not is cuz most of the time the design tak nmpk pun (since it's only kat atas and my pants would cover it, sadge), so for the most part it just looks like normal white socks la. TAPI it looks soooo dope when the design IS visible (i think biasanya can see if i duduk?). i rlly like the simplicity tho, i mean like it doesn't look serabut w math (like other math socks) but actually looks niceee

**attachment: AAHSJDSHD/5**  
(yes im allowed to rate like that bcs i make the rules okay)  
i got these socks sekali w 4 other math socks to gift to the top winners of the first mathlympics i.e. alia, chuah, rizan, harraz (yea they were coincidentally all my friends HAHAHA) and everyone got similar designs but the math was different (we distributed depending on what they liked) - like iirc rizan's was trigo and alia's had bayes theorem?? I DONT RMBR but it's nice knowing we hv matching socks yaaaay. AND i also started wearing them to math contests including major ones like IMO 2023 + 2024 SO YES THE ATTACHMENT IS DEFINITELY THERE and i also think these socks were kinda what started my obsession w socks 🙃

## #2 - MIKE + SULLEY

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-mike-sulley.jpg" alt="mike-sulley" width="200"/> 
<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-mike-sulley-2.jpg" alt="mike-sulley-2" width="200"/> 

**aesthetic: 5/5**  
THEY ARE SOOOO CUTE OH MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING ABT IT IS SO CUTE. MIKE AND SULLEY ARE CUTE. THE COLOURS ARE CUTE. THE DESIGN IS CUTE. THE LITTLE FLAPS AS THEIR TEENY HANDS ARE CUTE. EVEN THE UNDERSIDE IS CUTE. AND MIKE AND SULLEY ARE BFFS SO THAT MAKES IT EVEN CUTER. 😩💗 mika was telling me they look weird BUT HIS OPINION IS SO OBJECTIVELY WRONG OKAY UGH HOW DARE HE DISRESPECT MY SOCKS LIKE THAT 😤🤬⁉️ IF U JUST OPEN UR EYES U CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THESE ARE INSANELY CUTE AND I REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OPINIONS OTHERWISE. btw yes these socks r an actual pair (i.e. intentionally tak sama)

**attachment: 6/5**  
I ALSO BOUGHT THESE WHEN I WAS IN JAPAN and i rmbr thinking it was cool that the two socks had diff designs. idk it's just so cute and makes me so happy and i'd be so heartbroken if one of them ever goes missing ☹️💔

## #1 - PATRICK THE ICON

<img src="/static/images/blogs/socks-patrick.jpg" alt="patrick" width="500"/> 

these are technically two pairs but i'll count it as one cuz sometimes i like to wear "monday" on one foot and "friday" on the other cuz it completes the meme 😌🤌🏻

**aesthetic: \*some very large number/5**  
DO I EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN??? 😭😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻

**attachment: 5/5**  
they were a gift from alena!! also i rmbr being in L2 and few of my classmates noticing my mismatched socks (yea at some point i stopped caring abt the black sock requirement lol) and i was so thrilled that i got to show off my monday//friday socks YIPPPEEE. (and ofc everyone loved it and laughed.) someone also pointed them out to madam dee waktu class so i got to show them off to her jugak HIHIHI that honestly made me rlly happy 😄💗

---

LOOK THIS WAS SO HARD TO DO AND IT HURTS ME DEEPLY THAT I HAVE TO RANK THEM LIKE THIS BUT YA UNFORTUNATELY I CANT TAKE ALL MY SOCKS W ME SO THIS IS THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO DECIDE 😭😭😭

to my dear socks which i heartbreakingly hv to leave behind: i am deeply devastated we have to part. know that i still love u and i will surely miss u dearly. we shall meet again very soon. \</3
