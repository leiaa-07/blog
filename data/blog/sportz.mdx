hallow this mornin i was dragged out of bed at 6.20am (take note that i slept at like 3.30am last night) to go for my bro's sports day to "give him support" or wtv that means (but he's in green house which i don't support cuz blue ftw obviously so idk what my parents expect me to do abt it lmao). OMG IT'S PLAYING I WANT IT THAT WAY ON THE SPEAKERS NOW HAHAHAHAHA okay anyway BUT THEN GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?? it started raining heavily 😐😐 so we're like half an hour delayed now and i hv nothing to do now yay (rip this is gonna be a long day). SO in conjunction with my bro's sports day (+ kpp sports week), i feel like throwing some shade at the sports houses + dumping thoughts on sports nom nom 🤡🤡

### (1) roasting the sports houses (except blue duh)

- **blue house**: yall are SUPERIORRR fr 🔥 blue is clearly the best sports house and very slay in every sch from what i know. many of my blue brothas are nerds and geeks irl (academic/gaming/movie franchise/etc., yes very inclusive), but idk yall somehow hv natural athletic abilities even tho tak train sangat pun HMMM good for yall good for yall. and u guys also take sports day srsly and do ur best to not let down ur team ykyk. oh and blue slalu power for relay/team stuff like we hv quite a few great athletes in general ykwim. yall are also very funnn and fun to hang out with but tbh yall hv pretty bad social skills 💀 oh yea and actually many of yall are hmm... not to say popular?? but like kinda well-known (!= popular) in school and so u always hv to deal with the situation of someone knowing u but udk them (totally not describing jack ahem ahem), mm but yea besides that yall are perfect and i love yall, 11/10 from me 😍😍 best sports house fr 💯🔥

- **yellow house**: okay yall not bad la, my second fav house 😌 yall are great ppl to be friends with cuz yall hv the WEIRDEST MOST BROKEN humour ever 💀 but like kinda funny la tbh. also yall alwayz like to do cringey things tapi lawak and i can laugh at yall so takpe 😍 like idk why but u guys love doing goofy things (for absolutely no good reason) that makes me get second-hand embarrassment ykwim HAHAHAH actually yea ppl in yellow house are great fun to laugh at and make fun of LMAO but in general u guys are actually such underrated ppl, like u guys are actually pretty cool peeps but u keep it lowkey ya know? erm tapi sports-wise, yall on average not THAAAT good?? like yall always have a handful of ppl carrying the whole goddamn house while everyone else is just happy2 and doing nothing 🙃 oh also yall are kinda dumb tbh HAJSJDJFG but at least u guys have that friendly semangat ykwim (doesnt beat blue house tho). BUT U GUYS ARE SO SOCIALLY AWKWARD WHEN INTERACTING WITH STRANGERS/PPL UR NOT CLOSE TO OMG 😭 but u guys are cool and fun so not gonna complain much nom nom

- **green house**: UGH yall are some of the most OBNOXIOUS ppl on the planet weh 🙄🙄 masalah korang kan, yall like to claim green house the best camtu TAPI YALL TAK PERNAH MENANG PUN BRUH LIKE WHAT THE HECK LMAO 😭😭 legit sumpah aku tak pernah dengar in my ENTIRE LIFE yg rumah hijau pernah menang in any school HAJSJFMHMH like whatre yall onnnn 😭😭 rumah hijau is like NOT BADDD tbh but also YALL NEVER WINNNN THOOOO AHAHAHSJRJG 💀💀 but anywayyyy i feel like yall dont even try that hard man, like where's ur semangat sukan ew 👎🏻👎🏻 also whys everyone in green house so glued to their goddamn devices like GO GET A LIFEEEE bro 🙄😭 and brah green house has like the most average students ever tbh like whats up with that hwjsjdjfkkh, hv nvr met a 200 IQ person in green house before, just saying eheh- yall are pretty nice ppl I GUESS but i feel like green house ppl belong wt green house ppl ya know what im sayin? like green house peeps are always besties wt green house peeps hmm STOP DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OTHER COLOURS 😡😡🤬🤬 okay actually on second thought that's not true for everyone but some of yall be rlly colour-ist fr 🙄 tapi yall are nice and friendly (like on the surface) but yall are actually so annoying once ppl get to know yall HAHAHAH ALSO KAN, CAN U GUYS LEARN TO SHUT UP AND LISTENNNN BEFORE EMBARRASSING URSELF BY ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS OH MA GADDDD I SWEAR BROO 😭😭 and stop frickin complicating everyone's life, can u just play along and not spoil the mood UGH and also why do u guys gotta overdramatise and overexaggerate EVERYTHING??! it's not that big of a deal okay like shut ur mouth and stop complaining bcs honestly it's a YOU problem 👎🏻 okay la that's enuf shade on green house, can't wait to show to my bro later (im such a good sister i know) 😇😇 also if it isnt obvious enough i dont like green house sooo 😍

- **red house**: YALL SERIOUSLY NEED TO BE HUMBLEDDDDDD 😭😭 if ur in red house, i hate to break it to yah but like, ur NOT as funny or cool or smart or awesome as u think, just saying that out of love btw 🥰 ALSO red house has two kinds of ppl and i mean ONLY two kinds of ppl: (1) the ppl who carry the whole house and are pro pro athletes, (2) the ppl who absolutely CANNOT do sports 🤡🤡 and why yall so competitive brahh 😭😭 if yall win just be happy la no needa shove it in our faces sigh 😔 actually idk what else to say abt yall but i dont like merah 👎🏻👎🏻 cam merah annoying ah idk but yall needa be humbled 👎🏻👎🏻 merah performance not bad but yall are so so hard-carried by a few ppl je, everyone else is useless 😍 also yalls semangat sukan is so like toxic toxic bad vibez bad vibez idk how to explain BAHAHSJFJNG like dia bukan mcm blue or yellow punya semangat, green pun same actually its so bad vibezzz- and i wanna stress this again, YALL ARE NOT AS FUNNY AND COOL AS U THINK OKAY 😭😭 u guys are sooo overrated 🤢🤢 uh urm yea tu je la but i dont like merah, i don't think that even needs a justification like merah is just so ew bruh

okay looking back i absolutely FLAMED green but uh it is what it is ✨💀 anyhow IN ALL SERIOUSNESS dont take this too seriously, i swear none of this is directed at anyone, it's just like.. my general impression of the sports houses lmao, dont attack me ples 😭 ~~and like, come on, you know im KINDA right abt some of the stuff i said soo...~~

### (2) cant have sukan without suka amirite

THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PUN SORRY but yea actually kan, i rlly like sports and tbh realistically i think, if i didnt become a math nerd, i actually think sports/running would be my main hobby 😭 anyway i miss sports day and i only got to actually experience it twice in kpp :(

but i rlly miss the competition/semangat/thrill/idk and sports actually helped me become friends with soo many ppl. one of the best examples is aida cuz like, waktu we f1 in melewar we both sapphire so we trained for merentas desa tgt and that was the start of our wonderful friendship 😌✨ and then waktu tu before the merentas desa, we wrote letters to each other pastu we letak kat bwh some batu, and our motivation was eating maggi after the merentas desa. anyway we did the run and till this day im kinda mad sbb aida was so close to getting no. 20 tau (LIKE SHE WAS ABOUT TO FINISH) pastu some merah person overtook her 😞😞 but anyway after that we went to the batu to take our surats and that night we hung out HAHAHAHA, and actually since then, aida and i hv this tradition of giving each other letters, and waktu last year merentas desa pun we wrote surats and letak kat some abandoned meja punya drawer dekat blok akademik f2 kat tepi tangga tu BAHAHAHAH good times good times 😭 oh and amelia too, the first time i talked to her was when i was in f1 bila we came to bangi for merentas desa cuz we were both sapphire (but at the time i didnt even know her name oops)

NOT TO MENTION i got to be house mascot for 2 years SO THAT'S AWESOME 🤯🤯 kak kae said smth along the lines of "tgk muka pun mmg la kena jadi mascot" AND IDK WHAT THAT MEANS but i'll take it as a compliment bcs being chosen for mascot is an HONOUR to me and it was lotsa fun 😌 (tho i wish we did a star wars themed one but nvm)

but yaaaa i rlly miss sports day especially while seeing the kids get medals and stuff and seeing my bro so excited to run nom nom i wanna run more laaa (i hvnt run much since last years mssd), my dad suggested mybe he can take me n my bro to the stadium track to practice running when we're free so i hope we do that hahsjdjfjghshsjf ALSO sapphire tak menang again this year aw man, that just proves how hard aida and i carried sblm ni (jkjk but also not rlly) 😇😇
