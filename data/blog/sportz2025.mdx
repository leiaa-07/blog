HAIII GUESS WAT GUESS WAT GUESS WAT im back at my bro's sports day (flashbacks to [this](/blog/sportz)) AAAA yay :'D. ~~flaming red + green house kat section bawah if that's what u're here for.~~ also my bro is in green but i showed up in my sapphire shirt + am supporting blue cuz im #LOYAL (and blue is like obv the best anyway)🔥🔥 also fun fact i could be helping out at YSC finals and having the time of my life rn if it werent for this event 😑

random updates/thoughts thru out the day:
- they just finished the "opening ceremony" stuff so events r starting soon. ~~today is gonna be a long day.~~ first impressions - well green house punya mascot is the frickin DUOLINGO OWL so RESPECT honestly HAHAHA 🫡🫡😭 also the sulaiman guy and his white accent r back, and also diorang punya house dances sumpah cam tiktok dances weh LOL IDK 💀💀
- okay my bro's 200m event dah habis so that's it for the day and now im bored yayay. and tbh it's not fun to watch pun cuz the school is so small so like there just arent enough good runners for the races to be interesting ykwim. selalunya one person will win by a mile while everyone else is just jogging with flavour
- BRO IM SORRY BUT THE RUNNERS HERE R SO LAME WHAT THE HECK?!?! so many of them end up walking padahal 400/800m je HAIHHHHH kids these days huh 😔😔 (okay on second thought mybe i shdnt make fun of them cuz it's not like i can kick a ball :/)
- random but i miss being a kid and playing in the field w my friends like ice n fire and falling and ripping my pants and hurting myself and getting dirty and getting scolded for it LOL (yk it was fun when u get dirty + hurt). AND I MISS MY SPORTS DAY AAAAAAAAAAAA 😭😭 oh ha also sapphire fricking got LAST this year which is like rlly stupid cuz i mean like bruh kenapa sapphire jadi so noob ~~without me~~ omg, legit so disappointed and i crashed out so hard haritu kat kmb when i found out LMAOOO (tq to everyone who layan my vent haritu 🙏🏻), anyway this just further proves how hard i carried during my time there!! 🥱🙄💅🏻 (im joking ~~but also im rlly not~~)
- JAP FUNNY STORY, tadi a guy lalu and then recognised my dad and came up to him and shook hands and they were both like "ayyy" and they both baru tahu their kids went here lol. then they started talking abt their kids laa and apparently his daughter is also in y8 like my bro (tapi class lain) then bla3 more small talk and then he and his wife left to go get bfast. pastu obvsly my mum tanya laa like who was that kan. pastu my dad just made a confused face and was like "im trying to work out who" AHAHAHAAH i edi sensed it senanya bcs my dad tadi looked SO BLUR tapi dia play along je but lawakla 😭😭😭 UPDATE: LAWAK GILA HAHAJSJDJF. so basically my dad literally could NOT figure out who this mystery guy is, so right bef we left he went up to the guy to apologise and explain that he literally cannottt rmbr where hes from. GAHAHAH SO APPARENTLY THIS GUY CAME TO OUR HOUSE BARUUUU SEMALAM TO CHECK OUR DOOR AND MY DAD DAH LUPA AAAAHWJDJDJG FUNNY LA WEHH, my entire fam just laughing at him rn lmao

  <summary>random rant abt my relationship w running 💔 (wow bnyknya R)</summary>

oh ya hi wassup this is me as im abt to post this (not at bro's sports day anymore) but wanted to add stuff abt running cuz i feel like this is kinda relevant here so: dlu kat permata i ran pretty consistently tapi aghhh kat kmb i stopped running (which i now hate myself for) cuz likeee idk there isnt rlly a designated place for running (i mean, takde track), and mm there were a few times i didd go running but it's like i kinda just run around the "girls area" like turun jalan then patah balik, back and forth - which as u can imagine is rlly boring, i think furthest i got is like 2.5km (??) which is rlly disappointing by my standards but wtv. but i think the main reason i stopped running kat kmb was cuz rasa cam malu/uncomfortable?? ENTAH AHAHAH but running there dekat jalan tu feels RLLY AWKWARDLY PUBLIC and i just dont like it HASJDHASJ. but kat permata boleh je i lari around campus so srsly it's just my bad for not getting over it tho UGH i rlly regret that. but anyway now im like trying to get back into running again (lari around neighbourhood je la) but ngl it's pretty frustrating cuz im NOWHERE NEAR how fast i used to be 🥺😓 i knowww i gotta be patient bef i can get back to a good pace, but it just feels a biiiit depressing knowing how slow i am now. and running is like very "quantitative" (e.g. u can monitor pace, stride length, cadence, HR, etc.) which i actually like tapi now i keep comparing my current stats (which are obv not great) to the time when i was still in my prime, so yea yk uhh seeing those numbers is HDASJHDSAJ. BUT anyway, i still do enjoy running so i hope to achieve a pace im happy with soon + get like actually good at it in the long run. and i hope to continue it kat uni jugak (mybe even join the boston marathons someday???) if i dont find some other sport i like lol, huhu learnt my mistake from kmb hopefully

anyhoww throwing shade at merah and hijau [again](/blog/sportz) bcs yes self-explanatory HAHAHAHA. yea i cant explain why but im so repulsed by the idea of being rumah hijau or merah. again, NOT directed at anyone, just general vibes of the team, so dont come at me if u're offended pls hehehe (but im like, right tho)

- **red:** i think i said the same thing last year but u guys r so delusional and not as *\*insert some good quality u think abt urself here\** AS U THINK so for the love of god pls gv urself a reality check. and uve prolly heard this before but u sometimes come off too strong my guy. and fine i admit that merah actually has athletes yg hebat2 BUT PERSONALITY ISSUE SIAAA AND TAKYAH LA NAK FLEX SANGAT CAM SMUA BENDA PUN MEMANG KENA FLEX KE APA AAHSJSJDJG 😡🤬👎🏻 but but but, yes merah ppl ada yg willing to defend merah w their life, but then there r others who lowkey rlly rlly hate their team and those ppl r actually cool HAHAHA. anyway i dont hv the best justification for hating merah but merah as a team is just so obnoxious la. mightve flamed more last year idk. also u guys are so defensive and are most likely offended by what i just said like HAHAH TELL ME IM WRONG
- **green:** OMG EVERY RUMAH HIJAU GIRL HAS A PHONE ADDICTION PROBLEM I SWEARR 😭😭😭 okay this applies for girls je: i think i said this in last year's jugak but i feel like u guys are very fake nice?? like u just actttt nice tapi senanya kau takdela baik sangat pun AHAH 💀💀 and once ppl get to know yall baru theyll realise how u're actually like ++ realise u hv smth against so many ppl 🫤🫤 u guys r just basic ppl in general which is not a bad thing, but lame imo HEH. there's no such thing as a quirky green house person (most are in kuning), yall r so basic idk. but that applies for girls je cuz bila fikir balik, the boys in green are usually just chill guys?? idk hijau guys r cool je (except for my bro maybe :D). but either way hijau is just very ew like idk how to explain my distaste for it, im just glad ive nvr been hijau yay. anyway unlike merah tho yall r more chill and dont rlly care abt what i say ++ lowkey agree with it. i feel like most hijaus acknowledge that hijau sucks anyway so hmm yall are self-aware at the very least 🙏🏻🙏🏻

i think last year i had more of a problem with hijau than merah but idk i think that's changed and i hv more of a problem with merah now?? idk actually but when i hear merah my reaction is "ugh" and when i hear hijau my reaction is "ew" 🤡🤡👍🏻 also im gonna start using merah/hijau-coded as a new insult yay (cuz someone said im merah-coded ystd BEFORE realising im super biru-coded and WOW that like rlly offended me). also it'd be rlly interesting if schools determined rumah sukan by personality traits like in harry potter hehe okay dahla bye bye
