**disclaimer:** for context, i got 9A+ for trials and 8A+ 1A for spm (screwed up bm tapi takpela kita move on 😞). that being said tho, take my advice (and generally, ALL spm advice) with a grain of salt, bcs smth that works for me is not necessarily going to work for you - but i hope considering my perspective helps :)

also, here's the link to our [**kpp spm drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1zyQf2nFNeB_13mk6XgpsNmIIQFAEMHNy) which i mention A LOT in this write-up. practically all useful references are there, so do check it out!! (and it's not overloaded with materials unlike other spm gdrives, so u won't be overwhelmed hdsjahdasj). and here's [**rex spm channel**](https://t.me/+jmaoINhGflg2NWNl), theres useful stuff in there but i malas dig thru it so i'll leave that up to u hehe.

### (1) how i prepared

okayy so i checked, and apparently i was still at a competition by 25 july lmao. and i rmbr i only started to look at spm AFTER i got back (like first time bukak buku teks and belajar format paper and stuff BRRR TERUK KAN T-T), which meanssss i probably started studying for spm roughly end of july or awal august la. and our trials started 30 oct, so goes to show that 2 months is enough to get a pretty great result :DD (buttt do note tho, i had an advantage in math + addmath + eng, which i barely touched at all oops. realistically, im honestlyy not sure if u can A+ math/addmath in trials within 2 months if ur foundation is rlly weak idk, but just stay consistent and ur spm shd be fine since ikut graph.)

kay mybe rn ur thinking like "aiyo lmbtnya start, tsk tsk teruk la leia ni, tak bagus tak bagus". BUT tbh i really really genuinely don't regret starting "late" 😇✨ even jack has said the same (jack pun start after hsd). in fact, for me la, i think it was a GOOD decision that i started late bcs (1) by the time i finished hsd, i felt a lot more focused, (2) my first exposure for many topics was directly from buku teks (not teachers explanation), meaning the way i rmbr things is betul2 ikut buku teks explanation/keywords (which is obvsly gud for spm), (3) not knowing much beforehand made me less complacent so i nvr glossed over topics or anything, and (4) idk i rlly liked starting from scratch and "going from zero to hero" LMAO it's fun, just treat it like a fun mission. everyone else needed 2 years, but u only needed 2 months HAHAHAH 😎🔥

okay well that being said, ik by the time elys reads this it's too late since yall dah nak habis hsd anyway, so u don't rlly get to make that decision of "nak start now ke after hsd". BUT if u hvnt started spm at all, i hope this gives u a sense of security so u can habiskan ur hsd betul2 dlu, and then SLAYY ur spm 💪🏻

okie so now i'll actually explain how i studied. the very first thing i aimed to do when starting my grind was to **habiskan syllabus** for the 5 info-oriented subjects (i.e. 3 sciences + sej + pai), and my approach for those 5 was basically the same. i would first baca that topic in buku teks and FAHAMKANNN betul2. but rmbr, the point is to have a rough understanding of the chapter, so screw the details, i didnt memorise basically anything yet. just BACA and FAHAMKANN jeee. and if i didnt understand a certain part, i would usually refer to youtube/google and that'd solve my problem, but u could also just ask ur lecturers or friends. and ppl are def gonna ask this: but no, i didn't take notes. but i'll talk more abt that later kat bawah la. for my first reading, the most i did was underlining important things. and later after that baru i started sticky-note-ing, but not for my first read la i think. pastu, after i habis reading the chapter, i would go thru some (and i mean, *SOME* je, not like drill2 a lot yet) topical questions after that. i used ticket to victory module waktu tu, but any module or topical trial papers could work too - but don't spend too much time, which is why i liked ticket to victory, sbb soalan dia takde la bnyk sgt. ah and also, i would usually do the topical questions RIGHT AFTER finishing reading the chapter, but i would also do them at random intervals like for example, 2 days after finishing reading that chapter, and then maybe a week later too. and ofc after i do those topical questions, i review my mistakes, then baca balik (from buku teks) the stuff that i forgot la camtu. so that was my method for covering the entire syllabus for the 5 info-oriented subjects.

tbh idr my rate, but i rmbr i finished going thru everything pretty fast, 2-3 weeks mybe? i rmbr for bio i did 4 chapters a day until i finished everything, but for the other subjects i tak ingat la honestly. i think sejarah i did like 2-3 chapters a day? yea so anyway, after i finished going thru all chapters for a subject (using the method above), it's actually enough to score decently, like seriously. i rmbr right after i habis cover bio, i decided to try out a past trial paper 1 (melaka 2022 iirc), and i ended up getting 32/40, WHICH IS RLLY NOT BAD AT ALL, especially considering that was just from a first-time read of everything. so yea my point is, if u understand all the main concepts, it's seriously already cukup to achieve a *fairly decent* score. the other 8 ques that i got wrong tu were probably the detail2 stuff that i mmg not yet hafal waktu tu.

okay so only after i habis cover syllabus, baru i start grinding trial papers, working on specific sections (e.g. studying for physics essay questions), and hafal the things that i know i need to hafal. i grinded lots of topical trials too, there are gforms for the paper 1 so yea. essentially i think once i covered the syllabus, it was just about doing trial papers, recognising my mistakes, and going thru the topics again and again and AGAIN. i think i khatam-ed each buku teks (for those 5 subjects) at least 4 or 5 times. usually i'd use the same technique too as my first read, which is to baca first (and this time, hafal wtv i need to hafal) and then buat topical stuff. also jack and i like to quiz each other a lot whenever we hv free time, and talking abt it with a friend helps solidify my memory i'd say. er i also used anki flashcards a bit, but i can't say for sure how much it helped.

okay thenn we move on to the 4 skill-based subjects (i.e. math + addmath + bm + eng). for bm paper 2, that's very study-able so haa study je la morfologi sintaksis smua tu, and ofc grind trials. btw, paper 2 bm is SUPER speedrun-able (if u dont write down ur answers). each paper like 5 minutes je to go thru sumpah. paper 2 is only time-consuming bcs u hv to write it down lol. so i'd just jwb mentally in my head for a section, and then baca jwpn to check my answers, then move on to the next section. for bm writing, i found it rlly helpful to spend time trying to write good karangans. like, i would give myself a topic, then i'd read some sample krgns first, mybe even research some statistics that i could include, then i would rlly take my time to write a GOOD essay. many of them i spent an entire day. some of them i typed out too (refer to drive nom nom). i think it rlly helped me collect good phrases to use and stuff. and then after that i gave some of them to cikgu to mark and comment. but then u also need to train ur timingg. i think in terms of "how to make ur krgn better", taking ur time is a good idea, but u dont hv all the time in the world waktu exam so yea u def hv to train writing fast too. lisan i just practiced a lot with my group + prepare script, and mendengar is just mendengar. so er yea that's how i prepared for bm. for english + math + addmath, i kinda neglected them for the most part tbh (u might wanna consider doing this too if u're already quite confident for that subject, so u can focus on other subjects), but i gave some tips on how to prepare for dat in section (3).

### (2) a whole bunch of random tips + advice

this is super messy ~~and headache-inducing~~ so good luck getting thru this part 🤠 also, i dont wanna give too many "study tips" like "oh use flashcards or quiz urself or bla bla bla", bcs i think that one is rlly ikut preference, and i hope (and believe?) u all hv ur preferred study method figured out by now. (just saying, but u guys hv sat for way more kpp exams than me so...)

- **chill laa u guys have time:** uhhh contrary to popular belief, u guys still have a lot of time left so dw dw. trust me, if u set ur mind to it, 3-4 weeks is actually more than enough time to cover the entire syllabus across the 5 info-oriented subjects. HOWEVER - if you dah tahu ur foundation is weak, do start practicing math + addmath now, and mybe also try to improve ur bm + eng slowly, bcs 4 subjects tu tak speedrun-able since they're skill-based. generally i think it's quite fine if u baru nak start study spm after habis hsd (well for elys u guys already nak habis so..) - but if mmg rasa so unsettled and nak jugak start study sekarang, focus on the 4 skill-based subjects and neglect the 5 info-oriented ones, sbb sumpah takde function kau start hafal sekarang, lagi better u focus on fixing ur math/language skills first. 

- **don't neglect content:** soooo many ppl are gonna tell you, "dah tak sempat dah cover syllabus, the best you can do is drill bnyk latihan and past papers." hear me out, i dont think it's entirely wrongg but also like... respectfully, it's kinda dumb advice HDJSAHADJ 💀 my batch was rlly brainwashed with this advice, that many of my batchmates just drilled papers even tho they weren't confident with the content in the first place 😭 truthfully speaking, i think it's quite hard to score well if all you do is drill papers but ur content is shaky. memorising common points and familiarising urself with answering formats/keywords is NOT enough. understanding the structure of the content as a whole is rlly crucial, and like i said, THERE. IS. TIME. so don't let other ppl tell u otherwise and just BELIEVEE in urself 💯 so in my opinion la, takyah gatal nak drill trial paper UNTIL u dah finish cover syllabus. cover syllabus dlu, baru drill trial papers!! nak cover syllabus tu takde la lama sgt pun, just set ur mind to it and stay disciplined 💪🏻

- **breadth > depth:** prioritise understanding all the content (which also means covering the entire syllabus), screw the details. far too many ppl in my batch tak sempat 100% cover syllabus before trials and even before spm in fact. (deliberately, i think. bcs we were brainwashed with that advice i mentioned in the previous point.) aaaaa i can't stress this enough but please don't do this 🙏🏻 it's so much better to have a rough understanding of main concepts from every chapter, than to 100% master 4 or 5 chapters only. 

- **stop stressing over answering formats:** honestly kan, everyone stresses so much over answering formats/techniques bcs orang takut hilang markah kan, but seriously it's not that bad??? 😭😭 like legit, just attend ONE (reliable) bengkel, learn the answering technique (e.g. jwb dlm points/table/bla bla bla), AND MOVE 👏🏻 ONNN 👏🏻 la weyhhhh, there's not that much to learn senanya, everyone is just dramatic HAHAHAH andd also, diff teachers/sources are gonna tell u diff things obviously, but just don't overthink it honestly (i know i was guilty of this tho oops 💀)

- **books:** if u dont hv buku rujukan/latihan, THAT'S COMPLETELY FINE. my mum bought me so many buku latihan and in the end most of them i tak sentuh pun, i just ended up selling them off HSJDJFHSHWT bcs for me, i preferred doing trial papers/topical trial practice much more than buku latihan, and u can find those for free kat tlgrm. to be clear, im not against buku latihan tho so if u hv them then buat la, but im just sayingg kalau u belum beli lagi, then maaaybe u don't hv to invest in them but that's up to u la. and for buku rujukan, again im not against them, but be careful sbb in my opinion lagi senang u just guna buku teks, bcs kalau u study from buku teks, (1) info guaranteed betul since soalan mmg based off buku teks and (2) u dont need to worry abt missing keywords yg dlm skema sbb those keywords are mmg from ayat buku teks.

- **mindset:** okay during ur spm grind, u rlly shd be locked-in focus, no more main2, so remove all possible distractions from ur life. even for me i had to ban myself from doin math oly (with the exception of bengkel imo + mathlympics :>). not saying u can't enjoy urself tho (i def played A LOT of tetris during my spm grind LMAOO), but don't do stupid things laaaaaaaa, i think ykwim by "stupid things" right (including stupid things that could get u expelled ya) 😭 er and then kan, u rlly need to be disciplined with urself. the reality of it is that ur not gonna wake up every single day likee SUPER motivated and excited to study, no matter how bad u want ur desired result. but u have to be disciplined enough to get urself to study. just cannot be malas la. so like i said, i believe 2 months is enough to get a good result. tapi, if u don't have the discipline to study betul2, then no amount of time will ever be enough honestly. if u find it hard to be disciplined, find urself a study gang and things like that ykyk, i think it's much easier to stay disciplined when u hv friends doing it with u. also personal tip: i rlly like going to class (even on weekends) to study lol 🔥🔥

- **making notes:** damn ik i said use wtv study method u prefer, butttt idk i rlly dont agree with taking ur time to make notes :// well ig short notes are fine? but i mean like, making pretty notes that u plan to refer to. sbb it's rlly best if u always always refer to buku teks for everything, which is why i recommend just adding in some sticky notes to ur buku teks. ig ikut u la, ik some ppl take pretty notes bcs they enjoy it, so if taking notes could be ur source of motivation to study, then u do u la. but i personally think it's rlly time-consuming and ineffective. and like i said, i rlly suggest that u refer to buku teks for absolutely EVERYTHING. so if u take notes pun, it's not the best idea to use ur notes as reference when studying. sometimes while reading things, the most i'd do is jot down important points on a piece of scrap paper, but not rlly for the purpose of "notes" ykwim. it's more of just like, writing it down helps me rmbr better. and after im done i nvr look at that piece of paper ever again. (also bcs my writing is illegible when i do that BAHAHAH)

- **take pre-trials:** ik u guys don't hv pre-trials, so i rlly suggest u organise it for urself. for rex, we had a mini pre-trials (using sbp trials 2022) and welcomed anyone who wanted to join. pastu jack tolong order the papers for printing, and kita smua bayar la yg join. and then we all set a time to sit for it tgt in class. to be clear, waktu tu kitorang mmg tak prepared LANGSUNGGG, and it's fine if u're tak prepared langsung too. at least u get to familiarise with the format, and also, it serves as a great wake-up call honestly (my bm marks were HORRIBLE).

- **amali leaks:** there WILL be leaks for amali. believe me, impossible takde leak. so when it's amali season, stay up to date thru tlgrm channels bcs they will literally pass u sample papers + answers (and for my year, mmg keluar betul2 ah 💀💀) so make sure u know whats going on sbb kalau tak ur missing out. and try not to screw up ur amali, aim for full score. besides that, i actually dont think u need to prepare THAT much for amali lol. just study from the leaks and u shd be good :P

- **ramalan hmm:** okay my two cents about ramalan - SCREW RAMALAN UNTIL LAST MINUTE. do not do not DO NOT rely on ramalan. study EVERYTHING. yea i think a lot of ppl will tell u jgn study ikut ramalan. BUT. a day or two before the actual spm (ofc by this time u shd be fairly confident with all topics), THEN YES. PLS LOOK AT RAMALAN. AND GIVE UR ATTENTION TO THOSE TOPICS. BUT ONLY A DAY OR TWO BEFORE. bcs istg, it's almost like ur choosing to be ignorant if u dont look at ramalan at all. sbb ramalan tu is based on analysis tau, so mmg it's KINDA probable yg those topics akan keluar. basically, study based on ramalan = stupid, don't look at ramalan = also stupid. tldr i suggest dont even think about ramalan until one/two days before. also, the ramalans for state trials are surprisingly very accurate for my year lmao. it's up to u la if u nak tgk ramalan or not for trials (i.e. whether u betul2 nak test ur level, or if u nak test how u'd do with ramalan). i looked at it a lil bit and yea i can say it helped hahajshdsjhdsaj OMG AND. for actual spm. LOOK OUT FOR ANDREW CHOO PUNYA RAMALAN (ada dekat tiktok). hes famous for predicting things HAHAHAHAH

- **the "best" study technique:** broskis broskis STOPP tryna search for the "best" study technique 😭😭 BCS THERE ISNT ONE. at the end of the day it rlly depends on u, so stop stop stop wasting ur time on youtube or social media trying to learn study/note-taking techniques. even sharing how i studied in the prev section feels so ew to me rn cuz like, u srsly dont have to follow how i studied to do well in spm, everyone has their own ways la 😭😭 seriously dont waste time getting too caught up in "how shd i study", AND JUST DO IT BROOO 💯💪🏻 JUST. START. the important thing is u stay disciplined and consistent. pick smth that u think will work AND STICK TO ITTTTTTTTTT. DONT OVERTHINK IT. JUST STUDYYYYYYYYYYYYY OKAYYY. otherwise in a few months from now, u'll regret not studying betul2 just bcs u hvnt found "the right study technique" yet. JUST DO ITTTTT AAAAHDSJAHDAJ (nike needs to sponsor me fr 😒)

- **embrace ur fate in kpp:** HSJDJFJG okay this one is an off topic but serious note. er how do i put this, i think many of us (yea myself included dulu2) slalu complain abt how kpp tak prep us well utk spm + kitorang terpaksa start lmbt sbb hsd. and well, sure that's kinda true- but the thing is, when we all enrolled into this school, im pretty sure most of us were very well-informed that our focus is hsd, NOT spm (and if u werent aware of this before entering, then salah kau ah for not doing ur research lmao). so obviously, ur probably smart enough to conclude that kpp is NOT gonna drill spm like crazy unlike some other sbps/mrsms. soooooo... at the end of the day.... can we really blame the school if WE were the ones who signed up for this??? like, if u know u're lactose intolerant but continued to eat dairy, are u gonna blame the food when ur stomach starts to hurt?? (okay WOW that's a super weird analogy- why was that the first thing that came to my mind HAHAHAH also there's probably a peribahasa/proverb for this IDK go find out and tell me lmao). ANYWAY my main point is, do NOT let kpp be ur excuse for not being able to do well in spm. take accountability and know that it's nothing else but YOU who defines ur success (omg help why am i so good at being motivational, dhar mann hire me pls). and also, CLEARLY it's possible to do well in spm in addition to hsd (as proven in the past by top students) sooo, saying that kpp is the problem is rlly not a valid excuse tbh 😐😐 on top of that, our lecturers are still putting in EFFORTT 💯 to help us okayyy. like cikgu shamim literally sacrifices her weekends to have extra addmath classes, so if you know ur weak then go attend laaa aduuuuu 😭😭

- **believe in urself:** kinda cringe tapi REAL. have faith in urself and believe in wtv ur doing. for example like, sooo many ppl told me i wdnt have enough time to cover the syllabus betul2, but i trusted myself anyway and in reality, i had way more than enough time brr. and like, be independent and stick to wtv works for u, dont let other ppl make u doubt ur techniques. e.g. i honestly hate pomodoro and i could probably *passionately* give a ted talk abt why i think it's stupid - BUT if it works for you, then so be it. u know urself best so just stickk to it if u think it's effective for u, even tho i might say "ew pomodoro sucks 🤮👎🏻". oh ha and, dont feel like, insecure when comparing to the rest of ur friends. if u need a rest day, THEN REST. and try not to feel too guilty just bcs u know ur other friends are studying, (im kinda guilty of this so fahamm je but yea). and mybe ur friends go for private tuition and slalu attend bengkel and stuff, but that doesn't mean that YOU need it okay. TRUSTTT in urself and ur abilities, u got this 🫡🔥

- **have fun hehe:** well YEA it's spm season, and not to be *THAT* person... b-b-but... it's just spm 😭😭😭 keep in mind that ur spm era is also ur last few months with the rest of ur batchmates who u've spent 5+ years with- waaaaaaa that's crazy isn't it 😭😭 so yea don't be too stressed out and enjoy ur time with ur friends hehe. the day before my bio paper (last paper) kan, like it's frickin BIO 🙄 so we shdve been frickin STUDYING 🙄 but nope!! instead my gang and i decided to go for riadah (wau healthy lifestyle jkjk), but when i say "go for riadah", i mean like, we spent waktu riadah to do some uhhh... ahem ahem ~~borderline illegal~~ stuff WHICH I SHALL NOT MENTION HERE HAHAJSDHSJA😌💀 anyway, thats forever a core memory of mine huhu. even late nights, i studied with amelia a lot, but then suddenly we would start talking and get so carried away even tho we shdve been studying HAHAHAHH and i mean, obviously i shdve been studying, but how could i regret such sweet memories?? 😔💗 also also, on a similar note of "it's just spm", i think er... wtv result u get nnti, u just hv to be content with it lah 🥲 believe me, i was rlly rlly disappointed when i saw my bm was an A, i was super emo that entire week 😭😭 and even tho till now i feel so... unsatisfied and frustrated that i can't say i got straight A+s in spm (like u gotta agree w me that straight As does NOT hit the same as straight A+s), likeee that's just the way it is tho💔💔 soo like, wtv result u get, i hope u can find a way to be happy with it (tho ik it's hard if u don't get what u desired), and definitely don't beat urself up over it. even tho u might not be proud of ur results, u shd still be proud for all the hours u poured in just for this ONE exam. not just for spm, but even for ur trials. if u don't get ur desired result in trials, pleasee just try to move on and focus on spm kayy, don't let it demotivate you 😭😭 OKAY DAH LA EWWW THIS SOUNDS SO SADDDDD SORRY SORRY 💀 OKOK MOVING ON.

### (3) specifc tips by subject

- **bio:** study processes. also definitions are not that penting for bio. damn idk what other specific tips to give for bio. okay i asked for jack's perspective so u can read it dekat section (5).

- **chem:** u rlly gotta make sure ur foundation is strong. e.g. camne nak tulis equation, charges of common ions, how bonding works, etc. oh and chem definitions are kindaa important (but not as important as phy). hafal ur oxidising and reducing agents for redox, and also hafal the colours for substances. idk i can't think of any other specific tips rn

- **phy:** go hafal ur definitions + theorems nom nom, bcs that's usually the first mark for a lot of the questions. and thennn, physics honestly bnyk gilaaa free marks, specifically the comparing stuff. pls la weh yg tu free marks je tho kalau u fhm concept, so make sure u score all of those questions. also make sure you know how to algebra and calculate things cuz obv physics bnyk gak calculations. for a lot of it too, just spam extra points lol, e.g. the jadual thing where u have to give reason for that chosen feature. idk but i think in my opinion, physics is paling senang out of the 3 sciences sbb soalan dia repeat2 je (more than bio and chem). it's rlllyyyyy repetitive, just expose urself to lots and lots of questions.

- **bm:** bm is paling bnyk i hv to explain. also, my friend tara from kdu gave a rlly comprehensive explanation of format + tips for bm, so again that's in the drive, go go check that out, it's AMAZING. okay paper 2 is very study-able actually. study ur morfologi and sintaksis, and those questions shd be free marks. then bahasa klasik, GO LEARN THE STORY (ada 2 je) AND STUDY THE TRANSLATIONS, itll save u sooo much. for the komsas, DO NOT WASTE UR TIME READING THE NOVEL. just fhm the main story, and hafal some (15?) peristiwa from each book (i.e. leftenan adnan + tirani) AND THAT'S ENOUGH. those peristiwa u can keep reusing them and manipulating them to answer the question. contoh je la kan, ayah leftenan adnan hntr adnan pergi sekolah inggeris even tho rest of kampung disapprove. this peristiwa itself u can use to jwb SOO many questions. for example: peristiwa yg boleh dijadikan iktibar, peristiwa yg menunjukkan nilai kegigihan, peristiwa yg menggambarkan kebijaksanaan, peristiwa yg menunjukkan kasih sayang ibu bapa, peristiwa yg menunjukkan konflik, HAAA BNYK LAHHHH. haa pastu peribahasa, go hafal all the peribahasa from buku teks sbb slalunya in the past years mmg peribahasa buku teks je yg keluar (tapi my year i got unlucky haih T-T). study also the specific things like peribahasa sama makna etc. OMG PENYUNTINGANNNN, penyuntingan is actually my fav eheh. haa yg tu pun boleh study. btw btw, materials for paper 2 smua ada dekat drive kpp so go find there la. oh yea pastu rumusan free marks tau, just make sure fokus betul and stay under the word limit huhu. and thenn, utk soalan yg dia bagi perenggan pastu kena jwb based on perenggan tu, u can spam points so yea just spam ah. OKAY NEXT paper 1, ni la my weak point eheh. for me personally i prepared lots of ungkapan menarik + hafal ayat and stuff and it helped me a lottt. i think my mistake in spm was that i overthink too much (which is the main reason im not good at writing) and also my word count i tak sempat check and im 99% sure my karangan A was above the word count HAIHHHH takpela takpela T-T plus it was first paper, so exam nerves jugak ah sikit. anyway, ungkapan menarik + krgns by me, jack and amelia, u can find dekat the kpp drive jugak. and then for speaking kann, what u can do is that within ur group tu, u guys choose each person nak pihak apa - for example for me, i took pihak kerajaan, and other ppl took like pihak ibu bapa, media sosial, sekolah, sendiri, rakan, etc. soooo as pihak kerajaan, i just prepare the common points + script for it (e.g. as kerajaan, i prepared a script for mengadakan kempen/bengkel/program), and i honestly think my group lisan went so so well for me sbb i literally just recited my script waktu tu weh lmao, smoothh gila with peribahasa smua tu 😎💪🏻 yeaa and waktu group lisan tu, if someone stutters then help them out and anddd apa lagi eh hmm... OH HA LUPA WE GOT INDIVIDUAL LISAN JUGAK. okay omg camni tau, a few groups are gonna masuk into the waiting room at once. kat waiting room tu is where u guys nnti akan dpt kertas which is where ur given 3 minutes to baca dlu. SO. if u bukan first group. usha2 la previous group punya lolll. aku punya en, aiman syafiq (same number calon as me tapi previous group) pergi angkat dia punya kertas waktu dia baca au, pastu aku nmpk ah ada gmbr kereta2 so while tgh tunggu tu aku dah prepare dah utk keselamatan jalan raya/faktor kesesakan etc. and mmg betul ah HAHAHAHAHHA (tq to aiman syafiq for unintentionally leaking to me 😌🙏🏻). and not just thatt, tapi kalau kau sesi petang pun akan ada leak from sesi pagi. yea generally just stay up to date dekat tlgrm channels so you know whats going on brr. speaking mmg nervous honestly and i was SHAKING but in the end i think it turned out fine huhu. oh ya jgn lupa practice wt ur grp, im so lucky cuz i feel like my grp had great chemistry yay. and then mendengar is just ew. read the questions in advance and make sure u know what to look out for. also iirc takyah jwb full sentence, but most of the time its fill in the blank/tick cross/match match camtu je. ah one final thing, apparently all the tema (across all papers) will be drpd buku teks, so some ppl suggest to go thru buku teks tapi in my opinion it's not rlly worth it idk. (wow panjang gila i type)

- **eng:** okay paper 1, the answer sheet, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE LAST2 PARTS. my batch waktu trials, ada a few ppl yg tulis words when they were supposed to shade the letter utk the last few questions tu, pastu madam potong markah ah hoho. (actually idr if she rlly did potong in the end but yea). oh ha and then the one yg baca prgrph and then answer based on that, for me i like to read the questions first baru baca the prgrph, so i can keep an eye out for the answers while reading camtu. tapi also, english paper 1 u will mmg have sufficient time, sooo it's very chill lah, but ofc make sure to double check. i think among all papers, english paper 1 is yg paling time-sufficient, u could finish the paper in like 10 minutes if u tried hdsjahdasj. ok then paper 2 (writing), screw the word count guys LOL. for english it doesn't matter yay. ig for english writing u can do the same thing cam bm, which is to collect fancy words and ungkapan menarik. uhh speaking just practice with ur partner yea, again can do the same like bm which is to sort of prepare scripts and stuff. i think most ppl's pitfall in english is grammar kut?? idk but i noticed most ppl hv horrible grammar but amazing vocab somehow?? so to fix ur grammar tu, i suggest u practice writing pastu ask a teacher to mark and comment on ur grammar. eventuallyyy u'll pick it up ig. alternatively, learn how to use tenses from youtube maybe. (hmm but also, we learnt from bengkel that ur actually not penliased THAT much for grammar, as long as ur sentence is comprehensible.) but frankly, english is really not bad at all btw bcs the standard in msia is pretty low. like in my batch, 41 out of 62 of us A+ed in spm english.

- **sejarah:** TAKYAH. HAFAL. TARIKH. the only dates yg penting are like, kemerdekaan, pembentukan msia, sgp keluar (kena tahu tahun je), 13 mei, and... idk that's it?? ngl i dont rmbr la, there are probably a few more years yg penting utk hafal, tapi exact tarikh tu takyah tahu punnnnnn so dont waste ur time memorsing that stuff bro. mm pastu make sure u know how to answer kbat, sbb paper 2 is sooo much kbat, and ofc be sure to spam points for ur kbat. hmm apa lagi ehhhh?? sejarah very direct senanya, kau just bukak buku pastu hafal enough points from each section, and somehow make it stick LMAO. OH YEA ACRONYMS i loveee acronyms, use acronyms to hafal stuff yea. there are also songs on telegram (tho i personally didn't use that technique la). for me personally, my gang and i slalu revise sejarah, like it's our go-to subject to study while walking or eating (sbb like i said, it's very direct and purely hafal kan), someone would just mention a subchapter or smth, and then we would list out the points we can rmbr so yea that helped me constantly revise sejarah. waktu between maghrib isyak pun my go-to subejct was always sejarah and my friends (shout out to balqish yeay) would quiz meeeee 😍 and take note sejarah was like, the subject i paling risau tau (bcs bef this my sejarah knowledge is mmg so non-existent and i also mmg tak suka sejarah), but yesss it's do-able even tho i suck at sejarah 🙃

- **math/addmath:** consistency is KEYYY. math is a skill u develop over time so u shd set aside like 15-30 minutes every day to practice some math. make that a daily routine and it'll go a long way. i think learning/practicing by topics helps a lott. also train ur speed tau (especially addmath) cuz it's not just about knowing how to solve it, u actually have to be kinda laju too. and try to fhmkan the concept, not just blindly apply formulas and perform calculations. cuz otherwise ur going to struggle, especially with soalan kbat. pastu, learn to use ur calculator!! (check kpp drive). actually this is true for physics and chem too. last year waktu addmath spm, laksshan screwed up a question bcs he tekan "store" or smth so the value yg the calculator bagi is mmg salah 😭😭 (but dw he still got an A+ tho cuz he's laksshan.) mm and, damn idk if i shd say this but i'll say it anyway... even tho everyone likes to say addmath is a killer subject, u probably don't actually hv to worry as much as u think lol... well, that's my opinion la. cuz mmg la rmai org punya trial results scary, tapi ye la tu sbb paper addmath mmg susah + time factor, but real spm follows a graph tho so its chilllll. rmaiii je yg naik to B in spm from G in trials. so actually just hv some faith in urself and i think u'll do finee hehe. but the reason im saying this is bcs i dont want yall to get so caught up in addmath smpai tak study the other subjects enough ykwim. just practice consistently and u'll be good la dw dw. andd, tbh i dont rmbr the format, but i rmbr there are like certain sections yg mmg dia akan keluar certain topics je (e.g. addmath paper 2 section c? tak ingat la weh sorry), sooo i suggest u pick ur topics (for me i chose trig and the kinematics thingy. u pilih yg mana u rasa senang la + careless factor. like index senang but idk i takut careless dats why i tak pilih yg tu. compared to trig, i can lukis diagram and agak2 kalau my jwpn logic ke tak so it prevents careless. and i like kinematics sbb that one takes such a short amount of time kalau fhm concept, and jwpn dia usually short and sweet je so can avoid careless) and betul2 master those, so u can guarantee full marks in that section.

- **pai:** pai is like bnyk gila topicc, but each topic is very pendek and senang jee. it's kinda like sejarah honestly, just bnyk hafal2. definitely go thru every topic, but there are soo many topics so give ur attention to the few yg predicted based on analysis la. i used flashcards (check kpp drive) but honestly, even if u dont do that it's fine la, the concepts are easy but u just kena hafal keywords. kbat is pretty easy to score too, and again, u can spamm (for factual questions too). i think all topics are pretty senang except sirah is a bitt heavy cuz it gets confusing. (i was really bad at sirah.) oh yea and for me i referred to the complete rumi notes (ada kat kpp drive) sbb dia lagi compact and also my brain just processes stuff faster in rumi than jawi tbh 😵 oh and utqh, utqh quite senangla honestly sbb benda yg keluar tu is limited and we already know dia akan keluar apa (for the 100th time, refer kpp drive). okay so tilawah senang, baca je and u can literally prep in advance. hadis pun senang, baca jugak, and pronunciation tu search je dekat youtube and dengar. pastu hafazan hafal je la, and tak bnyk pun yg kena hafal actually. oh and u guys dah hafal last year kann, haa so kacang je la for yall. and also, for my year, ustaz/ustazah kitorang je yg grade, takde orang luar pun so that reduces the nerves a bit la.

### (4) test-taking tips:

- **the usual:** okay the usual stuff - take care of ur health, rest well, eat well, bla bla bla. do everything in ur power to avoid anything that could hold u back e.g. penat/sakit/injured/etc. during my addmath paper, i had a really bad stomach ache (tak ingat la makan apa waktu tu) and i think it kinda affected my performance oof. kinda glad it was addmath of all subjects tho, but it was TRAUMATISING, like imagine tryna do addmath when it feels like ur stomach is trying to kill you 💀💀 haa also prepare ur stationery, baju, exam slip, ic and all that la so that pagi tu tak rushhhh

- **the night before:** funny story - the night before addmath spm, emir stayed up dekat class to study tau. oh ya also sbb waktu tu the kittens were there so he nak stay there to jaga the kittens. ANYWAY. fast forward to the next day, and we're taking attendance before masuk hall, and guess who's not there? EMIR 🤡🤡 guess where he was? SOUND ASLEEP IN CLASS 🥰🥰 tapi in the end it was all good sbb nasib baik kita perasan awal2, then we woke him up and then he rush to bilik and laju2 get ready and prepare his stuff, TAPI RUSH GILA AND HE TERUS HAD TO MASUK HALL, NO TIME TO MENTALLY PREPARE. 💀💀 yea but actually im not rlly rlly against staying up late, but like, 1.30am max la guys 😭😭 if ur tired the next day, susah weh nak perform, so get ur sleep la. anddd pagi tu make sure u can wake up (don't be like emir hshs). failing spm sucks, but EVEN WORSE is not waking up for it.

- **right before the exam:** okay this one ikut orang. if u know ur the kinda person to panic right before the exam, then i suggest don't do anything before the exam, and just tenangkan diri. but on the other hand, if ur very chill and for some reason can't comprehend the magnitude of spm (like me :D), then by all means, go ahead and study right before the exam HAHAHAHAH my last-minute cram has actually been proven to be very useful to me waktu trials lololol, short-term memory ftw 💯 but if yk u'll be panicking, then don't feel pressured to study (even tho others around u might be studying), just CHILL - sbb nnti kalau tak u'll realise there's so much u don't know pastu u panic la overthink la and then last2 screw up ur exam so YEA don't do that. and even if u did study while panicking, info tu takkan masuk anyway so u might as well just chill.

- **have a gameplan:** at this point, u shd know dah how to approach ur paper. e.g. for me, addmath i buat section c first, bm paper 2 i buat rumusan first, etc. soo before that i suggest u think it thru abt how it's best for u to approach the paper + manage ur time. this one is up to u bcs diff ppl hv diff preferences, but i think it's quite important to plan out ur time well.

- **few minutes before starting:** okay question, how much time is allocated for bm paper 1? 🤔 if u said 2 hours, then congrats, ur wrong!! 😇 u actually have an additional 10-15 minutes. why? bcs before u start, they'll get u to flip thru the paper to check that every page is there. ofc, check that every page is there la. BUT ALSO. feel free to read the questions and prepare ur answers in advance 🔥 for writing especially, i think it helps. decide which question u want to pick before even starting the paper, and start brainstorming ur points. IT SAVES TIME. besides that just chill and prayyy for the best 🤲🏻✨ and try not to panic 🙏🏻

- **upon starting:** if u had some info that u crammed RIGHT BEFORE the exam and u takut lupa, quickly jot it down in a blank place on ur paper lol. then u can do the rest of the exam without having to worry that u'll lupa.

- **don't be indecisive:** okay for many subjects, akan ada a section where u get to pick which questions u nak jawab kan, PLS DON'T SPEND TOO LONG DECIDING. i took so long deciding waktu my trials for physics HDSJAHDASJ. but dont waste time, u could even decide while flipping thru ur paper like what i said previously.

- **right after the exam:** yeaaa i dont see anything wrong with discussing the paper after that, but decide wisely bcs (1) especially if it's in between papers, u're wasting valuable time that could be spent studying instead, and (2) it could seriously seriously shatter ur confidence if u suddenly found out u made a huge mistake.

- **move on:** after exam habis for one subject, don't think too much ah. if it went well, then good. if it went horribly, move on je la, and continue to do ur best for the rest of the subjects.
