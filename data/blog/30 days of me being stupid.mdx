math oly makes me feel **REALLY STUPID** every single day. like for the past 3 years, every day i'd spend HOURSSS on problems i can't solve, to the point that im literally soo used to always feeling stupid (not necessarily in a bad way tho?). plus, everyone around me in bengkel imo has like at least twice my iq and are sweeping 2 or 3 kinds of olympiads at once (+chess +scrabble +idk), meanwhile im struggling to even get decently good at one ðŸ¥²ðŸ’€ SO, today is 16 june, which means i hv exactly 30 days till imo day 1. soo to prove my point, i decided it'd be fun to document the things that make me feel stupid every day for these 30 days HAHAHAHHA

**day 1:** got another 0 in today's mock heh (*smiles in pain). completely failed today's p4 (which used some QR stuff), AND to make things worse, megavan said that question was JOM-able (i.e. suitable for junior math oly) so basically that means i failed at a junior-level problem, how nice to know huh ðŸ’”ðŸ’”

**day 2:** today is raya haji so i was out like the whole day, implying that i basically didn't do any math at all (besides a lil bit at night). so yea not doing math today makes me feel like im making myself stupid wee woo. (if i do math, i feel stupid. if i DONT do math, i also feel stupid. conclusion: stupidity is a not a choice for me ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡)

**day 3:** i was STRUGGLINGGG with some problem involving orders/primitive roots, and as i was doing it i was like, "oh damn i rmbr i did smth like this in TST and the same thing can be applied here," BUT I WAS STRUGGLING WHICH MEANSSSSS I'VE ONLY GOTTEN DUMBER HELPPP ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ also my brain shortcircuit-ed and i cdnt understand why x | a, x | b implies x | gcd(a,b) which is like super fundamental ðŸ’€ oh yea and also i got rejected from petronas today so ouch ðŸ¥² my self-esteem today ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰

**day 4**: AAAAA today my brain said "x^(p-1/2)=-1 (mod p) implies x is a primitive root" PLEASE SAVE ME I FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN HAS LOST ALL ITS JUICE ðŸ’€ðŸ˜”
