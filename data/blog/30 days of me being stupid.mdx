math oly makes me feel **REALLY STUPID** every single day. like for the past 3 years, every day i'd spend HOURSSS on problems i can't solve, to the point that im literally soo used to always feeling stupid (not necessarily in a bad way tho?). plus, everyone around me in bengkel imo has like at least twice my iq and are sweeping 2 or 3 kinds of olympiads at once (+chess +scrabble +idk), meanwhile im struggling to even get decently good at one 🥲💀 SO, today is 16 june, which means i hv exactly 30 days till imo day 1. soo to prove my point, i decided it'd be fun to document the things that make me feel stupid every day for these 30 days HAHAHAHHA

---

**day 1:** got another 0 in today's mock heh (*smiles in pain). completely failed today's p4 (which used some QR stuff), AND to make things worse, megavan said that question was JOM-able (i.e. suitable for junior math oly) so basically that means i failed at a junior-level problem, how nice to know huh 💔💔

**day 2:** today is raya haji so i was out like the whole day, implying that i basically didn't do any math at all (besides a lil bit at night). so yea not doing math today makes me feel like im making myself stupid wee woo. (if i do math, i feel stupid. if i DONT do math, i also feel stupid. conclusion: stupidity is a not a choice for me 😇😇)

**day 3:** i was STRUGGLINGGG with some problem involving orders/primitive roots, and as i was doing it i was like, "oh damn i rmbr i did smth like this in TST and the same thing can be applied here," BUT I WAS STRUGGLING WHICH MEANSSSSS I'VE ONLY GOTTEN DUMBER HELPPP 😭😭 also my brain shortcircuit-ed and i cdnt understand why x | a, x | b implies x | gcd(a,b) which is like super fundamental 💀 my self-esteem today 📉📉

**day 4:** AAAAA today my brain said "x^(p-1/2)=-1 (mod p) implies x is a primitive root" PLEASE SAVE ME I FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN HAS LOST ALL ITS JUICE 😔

**day 5:** non-math oly instance first - was practicing for interviews in malay, and i wanted to say "upload" (which is memuatnaik), but i literally FORGOT the word and said **"menaikmuat"** AAAADHSAJDHAS 💀 anyway i am so absolutely mind-blowingly astoundingly **STUPID** in the language that's supposed to be my "mother tongue", and im actually so unprepared for interviews in general 😐 okay math oly one - at night i joined a session with vladimir (imo 2009 gold medallist), and it was just me n him at first. and then someone (she-who-shall-not-be-named), joined in. and basically last week she proposed some frickin INSANE polynomial problem, so they continued to discuss their progress while i was just there like 😐😐 and she's 2 years younger than me so YEA that reminded me im DUMB. (ok i hope she nvr sees this but if ur her: stop making me feel stupid. thanks.)

**day 6:** PFFTTT didn't do math oly today (besides coming up with a few problem proposals) but i always find a way to be stupid!! for context, the comment system thats used in this site is an external service, which i found while hunting for the best (free) comment system. ok u can prolly see where this is going. APPARENTLY, they USED to hv a free plan. but i just figured out only today that... they... don't anymore 💀💀 HDSJADHASJ WHY AM I SO STUPID 😭 so either i'll migrate to another comment system (that's free but sucks + i lose existing comments), OR i could pay $4/month to keep this one. ~~or i could exploit free trials.~~

**day 7:** hallo today while grading ysc, my brain took forever to process that p+(p+2)=4^k implies p+1=2^(2k-1) ☹️☹️ lol then in the meantime, daryl and i attempted the ysc linguistics problems and ERR kinda failed 😭😭 also the problem we tried had an avg score of like 6/13 (according to ming wen) and we could barely make sense of it AAHDSJHDAJ

**day 8:** OKAY TODAY WAS JUST A RLLY BAD DAY AND I DIDNT DO ANY MATH OLY SO MY IQ DROPPED BY 200 POINTS TODAY SLAY 🥲🥲

**day 9:** uhh ykyk imo 2022 p2 which everyone says like "shdnt be a p2", "easier than p1", "this is 5M" - yea i learnt the sol a long time ago but i forgot it so i decided to revisit it today AND IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO FIGURE IT OUT BRUH 💀 AND TAKE NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T RLLY RMBR THE SOL, IVE STILL SEEN IT BEFORE THOOO AAAAAAA IM DOIN SO BAD RN

**day 10:** hello today i wasn't able to solve an N1 which i've seen before 2 or 3 years ago!! how amazing!! i love being reminded that i can't even solve the easiest N on ISL - even if i've seen its sol before!! 😇💞

**day 11:** off topic but I CUT A CAN IN HALF TODAY USING NOTHING ELSE BUT A CAN.

**day 12:** okay ive known the theory for QRs for so long now but i legit nvr used it and nvr knew how to use it. so on the bright side, i just figured out a good way to use it!! on the down side, i **JUST** figured out a good way to use it 💀💀

**day 13:** im not proud of it but i gave up on a few NT problems without trying it properly, and just straight up read their sols on aops 😭😭 also there was this one problem i saw a long time ago from MONT, and i cdnt solve it HDASJHDAJSHJ 🥲 AAAAA THIS IS HORRIBLE

**day 14:** lmao while waiting to be called in for my interview today, i decided to look thru balkan MO SL NT problems, and just go thru the sols... but... WHY ARE THEY SO DIFFICULT BRUH?? OR AM I GENUINELY THAT STUPID?? like i was looking at the N1s and theyre so DIE 💀 yea i prolly shdve done smth else bef the interview instead of demolishing my self-confidence 😐

**day 15:** uhhhh my day felt non-existent...? i looked at some NT stuff but decided i shd go back to A and C. guess what... I CAN'T EVEN DO BASIC C INDUCTION AAAAAAAAAA ☹️☹️ tmr hardcore FT begins ~~so im looking forward to more 0s yay~~

**day 16:** mock p1 today was NT and one part of it is to find construction but... my. IDIOT. brain. overkilled. with. some. stupid. wacky. existence. thingy. even. tho. the. direct. construction. was. DAMN. SIMPLE. 💔 kinda embarrassing how i missed smth so easy and obvious honestly aaaaaa 😭 also the p2 was literally trivial and i spent way longer than i shdve ☹️ hahshdfjgj i think my geom skills hv seriously deteriorated after 2 months of neglect 💀💀

**day 17:** idk what i did today la. overall a pretty useless day for me which means im only getting dumber!! 🥳🥳

**day 18:** didn't do math oly cuz had a scholarship assessment the entire day, but everyone around me was super smart and cool and social and it made me feel a bit er 😔😔. but honestly it was rlly nice getting to know them so wtv la. also when i had to leave, i cdnt find my IC this morning and confidently told my mum it was with her but uhhh it WASNT, and my stupid brain cdnt rmbr where i put it (but i found it eventually) so yea u can imagine my mum was mad at me for being forgetful, irresponsible and last minute 👍🏻👍🏻

**day 19:** ANOTHER 0 TO ADD TO MY COLLECTIONNNNN 🔥🔥🔥 it was horrible and that 4.5 hours was pain cuz i was makin absolutely no progress. also im pretty sure everyone else solved that problem but me 💔💔

**day 20:** went to MAP today LESGO. also real mock imo (from SL) started today and i hvnt taken yet but i kinda heard abt how well other ppl did (including non-imo team) and i dont think i can live up to that SO 💀💀 oh ya also aida said she reads this so HI AIDA 😇😇

**day 21:**
