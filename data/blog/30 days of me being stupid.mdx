math oly makes me feel **REALLY STUPID** every single day. like for the past 3 years, every day i'd spend HOURSSS on problems i can't solve, to the point that im literally soo used to always feeling stupid (not necessarily in a bad way tho?). plus, everyone around me in bengkel imo has like at least twice my iq and are sweeping 2 or 3 kinds of olympiads at once (+chess +scrabble +idk), meanwhile im struggling to even get decently good at one 🥲💀 SO, today is 16 june, which means i hv exactly 30 days till imo day 1. soo to prove my point, i decided it'd be fun to document the things that make me feel stupid every day for these 30 days HAHAHAHHA

---

**day 1:** got another 0 in today's mock heh (*smiles in pain). completely failed today's p4 (which used some QR stuff), AND to make things worse, megavan said that question was JOM-able (i.e. suitable for junior math oly) so basically that means i failed at a junior-level problem, how nice to know huh 💔💔

**day 2:** today is raya haji so i was out like the whole day, implying that i basically didn't do any math at all (besides a lil bit at night). so yea not doing math today makes me feel like im making myself stupid wee woo. (if i do math, i feel stupid. if i DONT do math, i also feel stupid. conclusion: stupidity is a not a choice for me 😇😇)

**day 3:** i was STRUGGLINGGG with some problem involving orders/primitive roots, and as i was doing it i was like, "oh damn i rmbr i did smth like this in TST and the same thing can be applied here," BUT I WAS STRUGGLING WHICH MEANSSSSS I'VE ONLY GOTTEN DUMBER HELPPP 😭😭 also my brain shortcircuit-ed and i cdnt understand why x | a, x | b implies x | gcd(a,b) which is like super fundamental 💀 oh yea and also i got rejected from petronas today so ouch 🥲 my self-esteem today 📉📉

**day 4:** AAAAA today my brain said "x^(p-1/2)=-1 (mod p) implies x is a primitive root" PLEASE SAVE ME I FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN HAS LOST ALL ITS JUICE 😔

**day 5:** non-math oly instance first - was practicing for interviews in malay, and i wanted to say "upload" (which is memuatnaik), but i literally FORGOT the word and said **"menaikmuat"** AAAADHSAJDHAS 💀 anyway i am so absolutely mind-blowingly astoundingly **STUPID** in the language that's supposed to be my "mother tongue", and im actually so unprepared for interviews in general 😐 okay math oly one - at night i joined a session with vladimir (imo 2009 gold medallist), and it was just me n him at first. and then someone (she-who-shall-not-be-named), joined in. and basically last week she proposed some frickin INSANE polynomial problem, so they continued to discuss their progress while i was just there like 😐😐 and she's 2 years younger than me so YEA that reminded me im DUMB. (ok i hope she nvr sees this but if ur her: stop making me feel stupid. thanks.)

**day 6:** PFFTTT didn't do math oly today but i still find a way to be stupid!! for context, the comment system thats used in this site is an external service, which i found while hunting for the best (free) comment system. ok u can prolly see where this is going. APPARENTLY, they USED to hv a free plan. but i just figured out only today that... they... don't anymore 💀💀 HDSJADHASJ WHY AM I SO STUPID 😭 so either i'll migrate to another comment system (that's free but sucks + i lose existing comments), OR i could pay $4/month to keep this one. ~~or i could exploit free trials.~~ AAAAAAAAAAAA
