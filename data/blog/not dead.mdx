LMAOOO BET U'RE WONDERING WHY I STOPPED POSTING FOR LIKE 2 MONTHS HAHASJDHASJ 😭😭 anyway dw i'm well and alive!! 😌☝️

ermmm so school is pretty annoying and boring as usual, a lot of work which ive been procrastinating yay. also i need to think of good topics for my maa IA and EE and idk how dhasjdhasj. i feel like i shd be pretty excited abt it but idk 🫠🙃 also i think i shd start talking to more ppl and making friends and like... train my social skills in general HAHAHAH. tbh sometimes i wanna talk to ppl but then IM SCARED so i just... yea 💀💀 and sometimes i wanna talk to ppl for no good reason (like if they seem cool or smth) BUT THEN HOW DO I INITITIATE A CONVO OR SMTH WITHOUT BEING TIBER IDK HASJDHASJHELPPP😭😭😭 but yea generally i feel like school is boring and so im just constantly searching for smth to keep me amused or smth lmao, like talking to interesting ppl but I FEEL SOCIALLY RETARDED AND IDK HOW 🤓🤓🤓 but it's a bit ironic cuz in reality i hv so many texts i keep forgetting to respond to... 😭😭 idk la im so sorry im kinda stupid fr 😓🙏🏻🙏🏻 okay but, ive been hving a lot of thoughts abt ppl in general, might ramble abt that later if i feel like it. also i ended up getting a pretty good result for sem 1 despite my absolute lack of effort (i dont necessarily mean that as a good thing...) - ranted abt it in my personal notes, but feel a bit too exposed putting it here so yea 😬😬

school aside, ive been bimo-ing ~~and getting obliterated by every test~~ and also im dying in homework 😭😭 oh but the other day i requested for a place to do bimo in school on weekends so now i hv a nice room with ac (bilik ixora) to myself every weekend YAYYYY. hvnt used it yet tho cuz i had to balik the past 2 weeks to babysit my bro 😒 but i'll probably use it next week so im kinda looking forward to it cuz i feel like it would make me much more productive 😇😇 tapi honestlyyy im rlly struggling to keep up wt math aaaa, doesnt feel the same like before ☹️☹️ im not practicing as frequently as i hope to and i feel like my skills are DETERIORATING SO BADDDDD 😓😓

oh ya and random but my bilik is so panas at night weh... like im already an insomniac and the fact that its so damn panas makes it WORRSEEE UGHHH 😡😡🤬

ALSO I GOT INTO MBL-B YAYAYAY 🥳🥳 so my fam is gonna raya in turkey and bosnia this year 😎😎 and then kan apparently i just found out that im supposed to limit my days of absence to 14 days thru out my 2 years in IB (under MARA policy). LIKE BRO 14 DAYS IN 2 YEARS??? FOURTEEEEEEEN ARE YA FRICKIN KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE??? THATS SO LITTLEEEE DHASJDHASJHASJ 😭😭💀 and so haritu i already used up 6 days for MBL poland, which means i hv to think how to use my remaining 8 days wisely WHICH IS SO ANNOYING AND MAKES ME SCARED THAT NNTI I GET INTO ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL COMP/PROGRAM AND DIORANG TAK BAGI PERGI UGHHJDASHDJASHJ 😡😡🤬🤬 like i was even thinking of applying for the rationality camps in US and what not, but if like this no chance ahhhh 😭😭😭 and yk if u go under the school dia tak kira absent, it's only if u go sendiri dia kira absent DHASJDHASJ. tbh i kinda get why they limit the days of absence and all that, but kalau represent ur country or smth, SHDNT U GET EXEMPTION??? 💀💀 and i feel like as long as ure doing fine in school, then what's the harm of missing some classes if u're at someplace else that benefits u more?? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ then again ig they just dont hv the time to consider on a case-by-case basis. yea honestly it's quite a major downside of taking a scholarship - if u wanna do what u like then u'd be restricted A LOT. but back to MBL-B, i think mano, karlo, milly, mihajlo, daniel, pranav (?) r going as well. not sure who else...

MATHLYMPICS. AHAHAJSDHASJ YK WE DIED THE OTHER DAY SPEEDRUNNNING MAKING QUESTIONS. LIKE IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MARATHON OFFICIALLY STARTED AND WE WERE JUST SPEEDRUNNING THE PAPER HAHAHAHA 💀💀 in the end all good tho and the sprint baru habis last night. ughhh we were hoping to do it interschool this year but tu la, we started too last minute and also cuz spm awal, if we're lucky mybe next year??? man idk but also i need to fr think how to make sure the club can sustain itself 😓😓 there r quite a few juniors who seem semangat so i think i shd speak to them and get them to take on a leadership role + lead the club 🥶🥶🥶 p.s. if u hv any advice/suggestions for how to pass down a club + ensure it's self-sustaining, do share w me plss 🥲🥲

update from future me: WEH THEY (i.e. teachers) RENAMED THE CLUB (pintarian mathletes) TO "INFINITY MINDS" AHAHAHAH PEBENDE LAAAA 🤡😭

anyway tu je la for now kut, i shd start posting more oftennn ✨✨ pray school doesnt kill me 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
