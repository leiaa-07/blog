... is what i realised ystd 😐😐

### (1) sometimes my memory is so insanely good that it frightens me
so this happened ystd: im at mid valley, just walking around in the mall wt my parents. then as we're walking, i see this family there (mum, dad, son, daughter), and smth INSTANTLY triggered in my brain ⚡ I'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE 😨😨 hmm but where??? 🤔🤔🤔 i stopped to process it for a moment and within a few seconds the memory became **VIVID** 😱😱 so there was this one day (like, a year ago? idk but def not that recent) my parents and i had lunch at mr tuk tuk in starling. i rmbr exactly where we were sitting: in the corner, i was facing the mirror, and i was sitting on the right side from where i was facing. and i also vaguely rmbr wat we ordered, like one of the platter thingies, and we also ordered thai tea and i rmbr asking my dad what thai tea tastes like bef ordering it lol. yup yup anyway back to the main topic abt that family... they were sitting next to us!! 🤯🤯 and i even rmbr where each of them was sitting, and other stuff abt them like their personalities (?) which is kinda creepy ngl: the son and mum talked the most (the son talked loudly in heavy singlish/chinese manglish ~~and i was not liking his vibe bruh~~), while the daughter was like ehhh not talkative but not quiet, and the dad was the most quiet and just laughed at the dumb stuff that the rest of the family was talking abt GAHAHSJDHSAJ 🤡 oooh and i rmbr at some point my mum whispered to me like "so loud 😅" cuz yea the son was actually damn loud eh LMAO. but yes ANYWAY... aaaand theeennn... AAAND THENNNNN... nothing. 😐😐 ABSOLUTELY nothing. 😐😐 WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I FIND IT CRAZY, cuz why am i able to recall literally the RANDOMEST instance of my life with such vivid detail bro 😭😭💀 like okay fair mybe it's cuz the son was mildly getting on my nerves, but broooo ngl a lot of damn ppl make me wanna yell "SHADDAPPP" in their face ykwim, like he aint that special honestly? 🫤🫤🙄🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️

### (2) but other times, my memory is so embarrassingly bad that idk how i'll ever be a self-sustaining human being
now this was ALSO ystd. so i was forced to take my mum's phone and hand down my current phone to my bro (still salty abt it cuz there was nothing wrong wt my phone and i'd much rather my bro just take my mum's phone but she wdnt allow it 🤬😤) and so i gotta transfer all my stuff right right. then one of the stuff i had to do was login to my maybank app on the new phone la. yea anyway guess what? I FORGOT MY USERNAME. okay but nvm, a bit of spamming and i eventually figured it out. THEN GUESS WHAT? I FORGOT MY PASSWORDDDDDHSAJ😭😭😭😭 BROO WHY AM I SO STUPIDDDDDDDDD?? and the thing is, i rmbr when i chose my password, i made like a CONCIOUS EFFORT TO RMBR IT. like i was telling myself "THIS IS IMPORTANT. U ABSOLUTELY CANNOT FRICKIN FORGET THIS. ☝🏻☝🏻" AND I EVEN RMBR MY MUM WROTE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF SMALL PAPER, WHILE RE-EMPHASISING THAT THIS PASSWORD WAS THE **ONE THING** I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO RMBR. BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CANTTT RECALL WHERE THAT DAMN PAPER WENT AAAAAAAAAAA😭😭 anyway ive spammed like A BUNCH OF ATTEMPTS to try and guess my password, but i literally cant figure it out 💀💀 and for some reason, theres an error to reset my pwd thru the app, so we gotta go physically to the bank to sort this out or smth. so yep my mum is super mad at me rn and i might get disowned HELP 😬😬 (believe me, im mad at myself too tho)

**conclusion:** my memory is neither good nor bad, it's just absolutely STUPID in that it chooses to hold on to the most USELESS memories (like a random family who ive seen ONCE in my life and hv 0 connection to), yet toss away the most IMPORTANT information (like my BANKING PASSWORD!!!) 🤬🤬
