yayyy im FINALLY doing this 😮‍💨😮‍💨 (yea this took me long enough, huh? 😬)

### (1) overview

context/general info: mbl = maths beyond limits camp in rycerka dolna, poland from 8 till 21 sept. there were 60 participants from like, 24 countries iirc. ofc as expected, our days were filled wt math lectures/activities, but we also had lots of fun non-math-related activities. oh and did i mention that it's fully sponsored (including travel, for me)??!! 🤩❤️‍🔥 more info [here](https://mathsbeyondlimits.eu/) yay. also, i'm including the schedule here for easy reference for myself:

anyway, IT WAS AMAZINGGGG and srsly one of the best 2 weeks of my entire life!! i learnt a lot of cool math, did a bunch of cool stuff, and made so many cool friends who i'll miss like crazy 😭😭 rlly hope i can go again next year mybe 🥹 YEAH soo, this (long) post is dedicated to writing out some of my fav memories for future me to revisit someday 🫶🏻🫶🏻 but before anything...

  <summary>⚠️ warning ⚠️</summary>
  hi if u're not me then istg this is so boring to read so literally pls don't waste ur time 💀💀💀 and also, (similar to the imo one ig,) im mostlyy writing this for my own eyes so most things are mentioned without context lol, so um yea u're very welcome to read it but later dun come back to me saying u wasted ur time reading this ha, i've warned u edi 🤠🤠 
</details>

BUT THAT BEING SAID THO... i've learnt my lesson from the post-imo one (which ended up being a half-hour read cuz i yap so much bruh), and tbh mbl is more eventful than imo in some sense so NO DAMN WAY am i gonna write abt each day like in the post-imo one 🙏🏻🙏🏻 so instead, i'll just write a bunch of random things/stories that i want future me to rmbr (each within its own drop-down section), and so i thinkk this could be at least a somewhat enjoyable read if u decide to stick around 😌✨

(also sry but im not including pics cuz im too lazy :P)

without further ado...

  <summary>arrival: PANIK 😨 -> not so lonely afterall? 🫣</summary>
okay so i rmbr arriving and registering at the place at around the same time as emma and amila (but i didnt know them at the time). and tbh i wasn't worried abt anything bef, but literally at the moment i was registering, A TINGE OF ANXIETY SUDDENLY HIT cuz i suddenly realised like "i practically know no one here (okay there's karlo but i only half-know him) -> everyone here is super cracked at math while i can barely do mental addition -> what if i don't make any friends -> what if i end up hating this camp -> AH FRICK THIS IS SO SCARYYY ☹️☹️😭" yea but thankfully not long after registering, i met with kuba (who interviewed me) then ania (who i already talked to at imo) and i felt a lot more comforted so yay. and then i go downstairs, and SURPRISE SURPISE "HEY THAT'S THE GIRL (milly) I TALKED TO AT IMO". she was playing foosball wt another girl and i rmbr she was rlly friendly at imo, so i went up to them and asked if she rmbred me from imo, AND SHE SAID NOO oofffff 🥲💔💔 (bro we interacted SEVERALLLL times thru out imo btw 🫤🫤 but okay yk what, to be fair i did forget her name oops 💀💀 BUT I DID RMBR HER AND THAT SHE'S FROM SWEDEN 😤😤 but she did rmbr me aft i pulled out my imo jacket tho GAHAHAH) but yes then we reintroduced ourselves, and it turns out... we're ROOMMATES?? CRAAAZY 🤯🤯 okay then obvly i got to know the other girl as well, and i found out that she was maia, i.e. the person who im running an EA wt who i've kinda talked wt bef to discuss the EA. so i was like DAMNNN that's TWO ppl who i somewhat know 🤯🤯 and so tbh i felt a lot less anxious and more hopeful for the camp HAHAHAHAH 🤠🤠 (also at the time i met them, those 2 goofballs had literally JUST arrived and dropped everything after seeing the foosball table smh 🤡🤡😒) and then the 3 of us had a rlly nice chat in our (me + milly) room 🤩🤩 oooh then not long after, 2 indian guys arrived, and they were both at imo as well so we saw each other and said hi (hehe yay they rmbr me ~~unlike AHEM AHEM~~). yea so thankfully it didn't take long for me to feel less alone 🥹🥹🥹 (meanwhile it's been almost 2 months in kmb and i barely know anyone lmao help me 💀💀)

  <summary>dancing: suffering dizzy-itis 😵‍💫 + PERFECT waltz twirl ❤️‍🔥</summary>
okay so maia and i went for EVERY dance EA tgt (except the irish one) so yea we're practically pro world-class dancers now frfr 😌💅🏻💯
<ul>
  <li> traditional hungarian folkdance: ur arms hv to form a weird 8-formation wt ur partner and istg the hand placement is actually SO SIMPLE but my teeny tiny brain was struggling to get it right broo HAHAHAHAH 😭😭 and then at some point while we were practicing the dance w music, we had to switch partners and i was gonna partner up wt mano BUT WE WERE FRICKIN STRUGGLING TO CONNECT OUR ARMS AND WE WERE LAUGHING SO HARD AND SHE WAS EVENTUALLY LEFT SO FAR BEHIND WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WAS MOVING AROUND, IT WAS SO FUNNY HAHAHSJHDJSHAJ 😭😭😭 but yea gaboRRR's EA was super fun and well-prepared. and later that night, we performed the dance we learned during cultural night bcs yas like i said, we all became pro dancers in one night fr 🔥⚡⚡</li>
  <li> balboa: it was my first time entering the "gym" (not rlly a gym but yea) and omg i love the place cuz the floor are those kiddy jigsaw mats and i felt like a lil kid again, I LOVED IT. anyway balboa was fun, BUT most importantly, maia and i discovered that my limit of spins before getting too dizzy (to the point i cant walk in a straight line) is 5 HAHAHHDJSAH 🤡🤡💀💀 and then at some point, i pretended to die on the ground or smth??? (bro i hv no idea what i was doing tbh), and then we started doing sit-ups to symbolise dying then undying IDK LMAO HAHASJDHASJ. yea we were goofing around a lot instead of practicing the actual dance oops (sorry amila) 😭😭 </li>
  <li> waltz: so like maia and i were waltzing (but also i get dizzy rlly easily so we kept taking breaks lol) and tbh we were kinda ~~noob~~ ✨ chaotic ✨ at everything, BUT THEN we eventually learnt the fancy twirl 😍😍, and then we showed it to valentin (the guy teaching/running the EA) ~~and we were doing it kinda wrong at first but~~ THENN he called it PER 👏🏻 FECT 👏🏻. im gonna rub it in ur face again just cuz i can: **PER** 👏🏻 **FECT** 👏🏻, which is like the highest level of compliment u can get SO LIKEE 💅🏻💅🏻 AND IT WAS RLLY FUNNY CUZ AFTER THAT WE WERE TOTALLY OVERHYPING OURSELVES UP ABT IT, and then while everyone else was practicing, we went up to like almost EVERY person there individually for literally NOTHING ELSE but to show off our twirl to them HAHAHAHAH 😭😭😭 and bef we showed it to each person, i would totally oversell it like "get ready to see the greatest thing u'll ever see in ur life", "watch closely", "valentin called it perfect" - and then we'd demonstrate the twirl and ppl would just play along and act shocked and be all like "OMG THAT WAS CRAZYYY 😱😱" and honestly it's so funny to think abt HAHAHSJDHJAS 😭😭😭 and bruh then ppl would be like asking us for advice to do the twirl and stuff and we'd say like "meh not bad, but not as good as ours 😇😇" even tho they were doin it pretty good LIKE IT'S SO MEAN HAHAHAHAH. tbh i feel like it's not that funny when i explain it (it's like a "u had to be there" kinda thing) but istg it's so amusing to me 🤧🤧 also our waltz twirl was so gud and iconic that it even made it into mbl chronicles 🔥🔥💯 oh and unrelated but there was also girl guy stuff going on there AHEM AHEM 👀☕ ah yes and the first time we went was for maia's bday, and then we went again for a second time for my bday (it was technically the night after, but still), which is actually a kinda cool coincidence </li>
  <li> polish folkdance: lmao it was super tiring (a lot of jumps) so eventually maia and i just gave up and sat down GAHAHAHA 🤡🤡 and then we started showing off weird stuff we could do wt our body LOL e.g. maia can move her ears (which is proof she's not human btw) and then we eventually left to do i forgot wat HAHAHAHAH (sorry antoni) 🙃🙃 </li>
</ul>
  BRUHH help why did i ramble so much, i fr didn't intend this section to be that long, i gotta stop doing this man 😔😔

  <summary>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...: idk just typical us being annoying and weird 🤷🏻‍♀️</summary>
lmao so i was askin karlo how to pronounce his name and it's pronounced like kaRRRlo (like, roll the R rlly quickly? idk but karlo described it as an angry r which is a pretty good way to describe it tbh.) and it's SOOO FUN to pronounce, so ofc the most natural thing to do was for maia and i to start rolling our r's for everyone's name!! HEHEHDJSAHDJA 😇😇😇 so e.g. rusa = RRRusa, pranav = pRRRanav, leonard = leonaRRRd, nordstrom = noRRRdstRRRom. then a super fun one is gabor farkas ferenc = gaboRRR faRRRkas feRRRenc. and we started adding r's in random places too like leia = leiaRRR, maia = maiaRRR, mihajlo = mihajRRRo GAAHAHAH. and then idr who did, but we also came up with the notation to use r with a bar (r̄) like in recurring decimals 🤓☝🏻

<details>
  <summary>ART: pranav = pretty good canvas 👍🏻</summary>
there r vids n pics so i dont needa explain much, but basically bro fell asleep in the sauna (he always slept in the sauna), then karlo had this miraculous idea of drawing on his face with a whiteboard marker HAHAHAHA 🔥🔥 (and i agreed to it cuz earlier that day, pranav made a little scribble on my face wt marker soooo, at least this way we can call it even 😁) so at first it was just me + karlo + maia + mihajro who vandalised him (i contributed a teardrop :D) (and no he didn't wake up, bro was practically dead), but after we left, apparently there were other groups of ppl who went into the sauna to draw on him as well (on his body this time) WHICH IS HONESTLY RLLY FUNNY cuz like from an optimistic pov, pranav can be seen as our✨ community artwork ✨ as a result of our collective international efforts!! WHAT A WAY TO UNITE MANKIND ACROSS COUNTRIES AMIRITE 🤯🤯💪🏻💪🏻 also pranav said he wasnt even mad cuz he wdve done the same lol

  <summary>betrayal: KARLO'S A FAKE</summary>
basically there's this killer game thingy that we played, and essentially u hv to kill a certain someone by touching them wt a certain object - person and object are tasked by the ppl running the game. anyway my task was (surprise surpirse 🙄) to kill maia wt a fork, but then we (me + maia + karlo) were discussing our tasks in the sauna, soooo i just pretended i had to kill gabor after karlo brought it up lol 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ karlo had to kill mira and maia had to kill some random guy. so ig at that point, we implicitly formed a pact. but later that night, i whispered to karlo (when maia wasnt around) to tell him that i actually had to kill maia and he was willing to help me, SLAY 😍😍 (karlo's such a true friend frfr <3), SO we planned it out and he even went up to his room to grab his fork for me 🥹🥹 then everything went smoothly according to plan: maia and i were eventually alone outside, then with the ✨ gentle touch of karlo's fork against her arm ✨ BOOM MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, EASIEST KILL OF MY LIFEEE 🥱🥱 karlo and i both apologised aft that, but ik secretly we were both proud 😌💅🏻💅🏻 now fast-forward to later that night, im walking wt karlo upstairs to my room cuz i wanna sleep, but bro is tryna convince me to play table tennis wt him for some reason?? so we both walk near the table, then without me even realising it... IM... DEAD?? 😭💀 YEA so basically karlo actually had to kill me (not mira like i believed), which he slickly did with his watch - NOT COOL KARLO 😒😤🤬🙄 and so now he has not just one, but TWO kills i.e. me + maia. but gg tbh i'm not even mad bcs DAMN that was rlly well-played ngl 😹😹 unlike me he was actually big brain, and he was good at lying without acting sus (or mybe im just oblivious) 🥶 karlo was doin pretty well aft that too (like by the second day he already had 7 kills or smth), but he was eventually killed oof (i was rooting for him) 😔😔😭

  <summary>rebellion???: skipping lectures 😨😱</summary>
jk im a good kid 😇😇 and i only skipped 2 lectures which is actually comparatively good 😎💯 (rusa skipped like god knows how many.) the first time i skipped was the final day of the complex analysis one (cuz i missed a lot from the 2nd day and wasnt rlly enjoying it), but i just did boring stuff i.e. reviewing the HIT handout from the morning lecture cuz i was soooo frickin lost during that lecture oof 💀 the second time i skipped was the first day of the galois one: basically during the break, i was in the sauna with maia + blankets + heater and so u can imagine it was rllyy comfortable and WARM (keyword: **WARM**, which btw means NOT COLD) and so we didnt wanna get up (+ we were hving a hard time deciding which lecture to attend) so we ended up skipping tgt HAHAHAHAH, but we spent the time listening to gud music (like the nbhd and troye sivan) + sharing stuff abt our countries SO I'D SAY THAT WAS TIME VERY WELL-SPENT 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻 literally just vibing to music wt ppl is suchh an underrated hangout activity 🫤🫤

  <summary>EAs: long ramble 🥱</summary>
just gonna talk abt the interesting ones here ig (and skipping the dancing ones cuz yea i already rambled too much abt that)
<ul>
  <li> cultural nite: milly's!! very cultural indeed 🤌🏻🤌🏻 we did some goofy swedish dance, ate yummy polish candies/chocs, and there were many performances as well </li>
  <li> ppt karaoke: yea so this was the one by me + maia + daniel + leonard. i had control of the slides so it was pretty fun messing wt ppl 😍😍 bro when it was daniel's turn, it reached the last slide but it had no "thank you" slide, so i just left it like that la AND HE KEPT RAMBLING ON AND ON AND ON HAHAHAH. then i agreed wt maia that we'd clap (to signal that he's done) if he ever stopped talking BUT HE WDNT STOP TALKING BRUHHH HE JUST KEPT YAPPING ABT THE STUPID PICTURE ON SCREEN GAHAHAH 😭😭 he went on for pretty long and it was so entertaining watching him struggle to come up wt things to say 😹😹😹 </li>
  <li> paracoord bracelets: clashed wt our ppt karaoke one, but we went afterwards and anastasia was nice enough to teach us yay. honestly super cool 🔥</li>
  <li> estimathon: MY TEAM GOT SECOND (from the bottom)!! it was fun but super hard lol, we were sooo so off for so many things 😔😔 yo and that day i learnt that lego produces like 430 new lego sets each year WHICH IS INSANE </li>
  <li> debatable: debate wt targeted prompts + weird things u hv to do. mano was screaming at a wall, pranav was arguing why milk shdnt be in tea (very much against his belief), igor took off his shirt to flex his muscles, gabor was doin goofy tap dancing (and a handstand at some point) while being super pro-US (and writing some freedom function thingy??), leonard was standing on the table for some reason, and the whole thing was pretty chaotic and fun to watch so yea HAHAHAHA 🤡🤡 </li>
  <li> paper planes: MINEEEE. no comment. we just made paper planes and it was fun :> </li>
  <li> hand sculptures: i tried doing a 🤟🏻 model of my hand but im stupid and impatient so the whole thing fell apart HAHAHAH. kinda sad but issokay cuz it's my skill issue anyway. the other guys did WACKY things tho. sylwia did her foot (bcs apparently someone had a fetish for her feet or smth so she could gv that as a present idk HAHAHAH). anna and antoni did their face and idr seeing antoni's (antoni also did his whole arm), but anna's turned out SO DOPE </li>
  <li> embroidery: this one was rusa's and she was begging us not to go GAHAHAHAH but ofc i showed up SLAY 😍😍 it was actually pretty fun and i did a bunch of easy straight-line designs (tetromino, impossible triangle, tetrahedron) without much planning bcs i ~~dont hv patience~~ was #followingmyheart ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 also maia was bein a super bad student to rusa cuz she was impatient and just jumped into things smh 😤😤 but she did some actually rlly nice stuff like a rose + dolphin + f1 car (but also i totally deserve some credit cuz she used my phone for a reference pic hehe 😉) </li>
  <li> quiz night: my grp consisted of me + maia + gabor + daniel + mihajro. honestly im rlly dum and hv like 0 general knowledge so i barely contributed to the team oof 😬😬 also they gave us jane street cubes (rubik's speed) right before so i was basically mindlessly solving it over and over again while the guys were hard-carrying 🤓 i learnt a lot of interesting stuff tho like denmark's goofy tradition of jumping off chairs during new years 🤔🤔 we did well in the ones which we had to answer on paper, but we didnt get a SINGLE point from the speed round stuff (music and theatre). also mateusz was rlly impressive in music stuff iirc (like he rmbred the year of awards or smth idk). ANYWAY my team actually did rlly well and we ended up placing 3rd, BUT the first two teams consisted mostly of organisers so MEHHH WE WERE PRACTICALLY THE CHAMPS 😤💪🏻 </li>
  <li> origami: it was rlly nice and chill cuz it was just a few of us, so we just chatted and vibed while doing origami. i talked to anna a lot at that time and was telling her abt life in msia lol. i made a cute lil froggy, a black rose, and a vry pretty butterfly - quite proud of it tbh 😌✨ </li>
  <li> guess that mbl participant: mihajro's!! so we get randomised (not rlly but yea) names of ppl who we're supposed to make a portrait of and HAHA surprise surprise i wonder who i got (maia again, ofc) 😐😐 ANYWAY i drew stickman maia eating choc and ice cream in front of zabka (i spent more time on the zabka logo than on maia HAHAHAHA) AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD AND IM FR PROUD OF IT YAYAYAY 😍 i think it captures maia (and her obsession for zabka) perfectly 😭😭 and maia did one of me too and it kinda made me feel bad CUZ SHE ACTUALLY TRIED AND DID A FACE PORTRAIT OF ME WHILE I DID A STICKMANNN AAASHSJDJF (sorry maia) 😬😬😬 </li>
  <li> karaoke night: the EA i enjoyed most kut 🫶🏻🫶🏻 and it was run by maia and leonard so plus points for that, and extra plus points bcs it's how i spent the start of my bday 🔥 as someone who rlly likes music, vibing and singing and dancing tgt is just soo uhhh, for lack of a better word, NICEEE 😭😭 likeee it was so indescribably nice to let loose wt everyone and tbh idk when else i'd ever be able to do that again (~~msia is too conservative rip~~ 🥶) so it's probably one of my fav memories in life ever 🥺💗 also pranav was sayin that my song recs r rlly good and ofc i totally agree (viva la vida, i want it that way, iris) 🤩🤩🤩 yep anyway at first it was just grp singing, then at some point i got a SUPER CUTEE vid of karlo and rusa bonding over taylor swift, then me and karlo got up on chairs (it was nice feeling tall), then we did macarena SLAY, then i vibed/danced wt maia <3, then maia was showing off lukas graham THEN IT TURNED INTO A JUST DANCE SESSION GAHAHAHAHA 🙃🙃 oh and if it wasnt clear by that chronology, it dragged on till pretty late lol (i'm glad it did) </li>
</ul>

  <summary>zabka tripz: overdosing on sugar 🍫 + DOGGO 🐶 + SNAIK 🐍</summary>
maia had this thing where she wanted to go to zabka every day to buy ice cream (so much for saving money smh 😒), so EVERY DAY (im not exaggerating, we mybe missed like 1/2 days but that was it, and there were days where we went multiple times), she'd ajak ppl to come - fr the sole reason zabka's sales wdve been like 📈📈 LMAO. we bought a bar of milka chocolate pretty frequently (legit i dont think ive ever eaten so much chocolate within the span of 2 weeks), and we'd finish it like shortly after AND U'RE DEF NOT SUPPOSED TO FINISH IT THAT FAST (the packaging said like 3 pieces per serving AHAHAHA) 💀💀 and another funny thing i realised was that we always had chocolate during till's lecture so bro must be thinking we're munching on chocolates all the time 😭😭 anyway one particularly interesting zabka trip was when a dog followed us back LOLLL. and then it stayed at the campsite for a while but then the next day it was gone (idk but i think someone mustve brought it back out). and then another time, we saw a baby snake on the road and gaboRRR (being gaboRRR) was doin weird things and mocking it?? (idk) 🤔🤔
</details>




there was also ahem ahem ✨ spicy stuff ✨ going on at camp ☕👀 but it feels wrong to put it here, so to future leia: check ur google keep notes☝🏻‼️
