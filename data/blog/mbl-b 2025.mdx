  <summary><b>thieves in training:</b> learning the dark arts of pickpocketing 🥷🏻</summary>

we were walking in sarajevo and the tour guide guy told us to make sure we take good care of our belongings, or else stuff could get stolen 🫣🫣 and then like the morbidly curious person i am, i started expressing my fascination in the masterminds behind crimes 🤓☝️no bcs like srsly think abt it, the most successful criminals hv got to be legitimate geniuses to figure out how to pull off such crimes. and im genuinely so interested in what goes on in their minds and HOW they do it. anyway i guess milly was mildly concerned for me (i dont blame her - there r many things wrong wt me 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️), but we started talking specifically abt pickpocketing and techniques ykyk. then at some point we were pickpocketing milly's watch (which straps on rlly funky-ly and is so anti-pickpocket ngl) and we got a rlly goofy pic which i was gonna insert here but i got too lazy so meh. then we started practicing it on each other AND IM SO MAD BCS THEY ACTUALLY GOT ME LIKE TWICE??? 😭😭😭 milly was distracting me wt a handout and told me she was gonna show me smth, but they TOOK MY PHONE from underneath and i didnt notice, LIKE BRO IM SO EMBARRASSED THAT DUMB TACTIC WORKED ON ME 💀💀 and then there was another time milly took my phone which i left on the table, and i knew but she didnt know i knew 😏 then while we were at dinner i realised i needed my phone to fill out the feedback form, then i just put out my hand in front of milly and she was like "awh u knew? :(" SO IM PROUD I DIDNT FALL FOR THAT ONE 😌😌☝️

  <summary><b>IRKO:</b> the best olympiad 🏆</summary>

milly had to leave 2 days early and we like going on walks, so a day before she left, milly, artur, mira and i walked around konjic. then mira (?) found a viewpoint on gmaps so yaa after he did some convincing, we went up there which didnt take long (i wdnt even rlly consider it a hike). and then we just chilled there and enjoyed the view and it was rlly nice 🥺🥺 and also, while i was up there, i realised like "heh we're probably going here again for the mblb hike" (spoiler: i was right). AND THEN. IDK WHO. BUT SOMEONE STARTED KICKING ROCKS OFF THE PLATFORM. 🤡🤡🤡 AND THEN WE ALL JUST STARTED DOING IT AGAHAHSHSNFNGN. mira collected a bunch of small pebbles, tossed them onto the platform, AND THEN WE'D LAUNCH THEM AWAYYYYYY 🌠🌠 IT'S WAY MORE FUN THAN IT SOUNDS LOL. then i guess milly pulled out her phone and starting recording, and er yea i hv NO IDEA how it happened BUT SUDDENLY THE INTERNATIONAL ROCK KICKING OLYMPIAD (IRKO) WAS FORMED!!!! so it was me, mira and artur against each other, and milly was like the sports commentator interviewing us and all. apparently, ✨according to me✨, i'm from mars and the rock i kicked off was a martian rock, which is kinda why i was destined to do the best cuz martian rocks r way better than eArTh rOcKs yk wat im sayin 🥱🥱 so anyway i so obviously WON the irko but idk the other two kept insisting they did better??? but like im the bigger person here so i just let them dream on even tho ik im better, get what im sayin?? so humble of me 🥰🥰🙏🙏 okay then we got back and AHAHA krzys was in the lobby so we decided to troll him and we were like "ayo we just got back from the irko" "u've nvr heard of the irko??" "yea it's held in bosnia this year" "wait what, does ur country not take part??" AND HE LOOKED SO CONFUSEEDDDDD OMG HAHAHAHA, i lowkey feel bad 😭😭😭 but i guess eventually he figured we were trolling, then we told him what irko rlly was 🙃🙃

  <summary><b>avalon:</b> unfulfilled promises?? 😱</summary>

first of all i needa gv some context abt this patrik dude. HE IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PPL I'LL EVER MEET 😭😭😭 idek if i mean that in a good way or bad way cuz i feel like half the time ppl are laughing AT him not WITH him 💀💀 so basically this dude, likes to overcomplicate EVERYTHING. he just says/does rlly stupid stuff and it's rlly funny. also he swapped nametags with ziga at the beginning of camp, and convinced a fair amt of ppl that he was ziga and ziga was patrik 🤡💀 AND I KNEW HIS NAME WAS PATRIK but ngl even i was confused bruh 😒 also i shared the probabilistic programming class wt him and sometimes he would just say super random/irrelevant things in class and IDK just OVERCOMPLICATE EVERYTHING IN GENERAL??? idk how to explain patrik tbh, he's just his own kinda breed 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ anyway this dude LOVES avalon okay. (after the camp, he sent a msg in the grp chat saying to the organisers "next time pls dont make TAU at the same time we play avalon" AHAHAHAHAHSJDJDNG 😭😭😭). so there was a night i was in the lobby and he was looking for ppl to play avalon, but i said smth along the lines of "nah not now, but i hope to play at some point during the camp." and i don't recall ever **PROMISING** him i'd play avalon BUT OH WELL APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO HIM I DID!!! (i didnt, believe me guys 😑) so sometimes he'd see me and ask me to play avalon cuz i "promised" but i always had some excuse (i mean like, had other stuff i wanted to do la). BUT ON THE SECOND LAST NIGHT OR SMTH, I ACTUALLY DID FULFILL MY PROMISE AND PLAYED LIKE 3 GAMES OF AVALON. AND LIKE, I TOLD HIM I'D BE PLAYING. BUT HERE'S THE THING. HE DIDNT JOIN 💀💀💀 but wtv la i still fulfilled my promise so that's what matters. and then at some point he passed by us, so i called him out and was like "yo patrik, look im finally playing avalon, r u proud of me? 😌" and im pretty sure he just responded with a thumbs up LMAO. fast forward to our last night, i decided to write him a short note which said (and i quote) "yo patrik (or ziga, or whatever u wanna be), sorry it took me so long to play avalon LMAO - leia :')" HDSJDHASJ (yea i was gonna insert the pic here but then got too lazy). AND THEN AFTER THE CAMP HE TEXTED ME SAYING "you still owe me an avalon game" "you didnt play with me so it doesn't count" BUT BROOOO NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABT IT HVING TO BE WT HIM??? 😑😑😑 then i was like "i believe you owe me a trio game as well" CUZ YEA IM PRETTY SURE HE DOES. so u see at least i put effort into keeping my promise unlike patrik 😒😒

  <summary><b>waltz:</b> the return of the twirl 🌪️</summary>

so milly and i were at the waltz EA and we wanted to recreate THE twirl (iykyk) (cant be as perfect tho), but AAAA IM STUPID AND I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I... UHHH... KINDA... FORGOT... HOW TO DO ITTTTT 😭😭😭 LIKE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY IM SOO MAD AT MYSELF AHAHAJSDHASJ, LIKE BRO HOW COULD I FORGETTTTTT???😭😭😭 so yea i tried to do it wt milly and we tried to figure it out (my brain was NOT cooking tho, like bruh i cdnt figure out what to do with my arms and all that), and the entire time i was like reassuring ~~/gaslighting~~ myself that it's SOMEWHERE in my memory BUT UGHHH IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDDD 🤬🤬😡😡. but NVM cuz i rmbr i hv the vid of me and maia doing the twirl from last year. BUT AGAIN, WHEN I TRIED TO FIND IT... IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDDDJWJDJF?? 😭😭😭 LIKE, IM PRETTY SURE I SAVED IT??? so UGHHHHHHHH then we had to try google/youtube it, but the stupid thing is that there are WAY too many frickin types of twirls, and so we cdnt find THE twirl ykwim 😑🙄🙄. and we had no damn clue what to search up for THE twirl (like, idk the name), so i was like AAAAHDSJHDAJ. and then the organiser running the EA saw that milly and i were on the phone so she came up to us and asked what we were doing, then we explained we were tryna do the twirl thing la and asked if she knew it, and she said she knew what we were talking abt but she didn't know how to do it 🥲🥲🥲 BUT THENNNNN ☝️☝️☝️ we rmbred that ines would hv the vid cuz it was in mbl chronicles!! 💡💡🧠🧠 we saw ines in the lobby and i feel kinda bad cuz i think she was in the middle of doing work, but we told her abt our ✨situation✨, then she fished out the mbl chronicles vid AND THE THING IS, IT'S LIKE 40 MINS LONG 💀💀 but thankfully we rmbred it's somewhere in the beginning so yea we just had to go thru the first few minutes AND EVENTUALLY WE FOUND IT YAAAAAYYYYY (ines is a lifesaver fr 🥹). then ines replayed that part of the vid so i could record it from my phone AHAHAHA 🤡🤡🤡 (also random but ines had a notebook with klcc on it, which she got from bosnia 🤯🤯) yea then after rewatching the vid a few times we figured it out, and other ppl started asking us how to do it, we were the coolest ones in the room fr 😎 ALSO ALSO IN MY DEFENSE, i actually did rmbr the starting position and what to do with my hands i guess, but the twirler's role is harder than the twirled's (like in reality maia was doing all the work, i just had to hold on to her) SO THAT'S WHY I DONT RMBR IT OKAYYYYY ☝🏻☝🏻💀💀💀

  <summary><b>karaoke❌communism✅:</b> an interesting night 😵‍💫</summary>

the karaoke last year was AMAZING (probably my fav EA) so i was rlly rlly looking forward to this karaoke, that i even became an emote (reminder to self: ask milly for the video) - i'd bang my fist on an invisible wall while cheerily announcing "KARAOKE NIIIGHTT!!" 😇😇😇 BUT GUESS WHATTT, IT WAS DISAPPOINTINGGGG 😭😭 LIKE THE VIBE WAS NOTTTT IT 😭😭 everyone was sitting down at the tables, and then for every song two ppl would stand in front and sing into the mic (i sang "smth just like this" wt om). also i think the vibe was off cuz the songs chosen were not the best karaoke songs (like some ppl chose vry not well-known songs). THERE WAS A RLLY CATCHY [GERMAN TRIG SONG](https://youtu.be/SCDtLk9IbSw?si=leLU2mJr641sCH7l) THO!! 🤓🤓 but anyway mira and i got bored so we left and milly happened to be hanging out at the cozy corner (right in front of the room we exited) so ofc we stopped there where at the couch across us, kalina and rastko were debating capitalism vs communism (!!) HAHAHAH. and their convo was rlly interesting so we just went quiet and tuned in, and their convo progressed and progressed and also damian joined in at some point (which made rastko mad at times) (adi was there too) and milly had stuff to do but the convo was rlly interesting so she ended up staying for way longer than she shdve HAHAHA 🤡🤡 then eventually the convo got chill, and isaak came along and kalina was playfully mocking his british accent and stuff 😌✨ also there was some stress ball rastko kept playing with and it broke at some point, and also when they threw it up to the ceiling itd get stuck there for a while before falling hahsjdjfjgy

  <summary><b>egmo:</b> for vs against 💥</summary>

so some ppl and i were hving a convo wt ania, and then this dude came along and i think someone mentioned bmo (?) so he said his country doesnt participate in bmo bcs they hv to choose between bmo and egmo, and they chose egmo 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ and then, this dude very blatantly announced that he was AGAINST egmo, saying it was unfair and stuff la. so ania (who is vry pro-egmo and hopes to be an organiser for it someday) was like "woah woah HOLD UP BROO 🤨✋🏻" and so this is kinda where the debate started (we had to grab chairs and sit down for this LMAO) and he was asked to elaborate i guess. AND THEN. THIS GUY. HAS THE AUDACITY. TO START HIS ARGUMENT. WITH WOMEN. IN VOTING. BRO WAS LIKE "so imagine women can't vote" BROTHER WDYM IMAGINE WOMEN CAN'T VOTE WE'RE TALKING ABT GIRLS IN STEM HERE AND HDSJADHASJ like i swear we were all caught so off guard, and then ania cut him off (as he shdve been) BUT NGL A PART OF ME IS SO CURIOUS WHERE HE WAS GOING WITH THAT HAHAHAH. okay yes anyway, tldr of the debate, ania has amazing well-constructed arguments/analogies that can put things into perspective for this dude, but this dude insists that as a girl, it shdnt be hard for u to fit in with the other guys or smth bcs it's not hard to find common interests. what common interests, u ask?? this guy said... wait for it... ALCOHOL!! 🍾🙂🙂😭 okay now i get that alcohol is like a huge thing for croatians (he was croatian - told us how at math camps they'd go to the beach and drink tgt. even their MENTOR drank too much vodka as a result of losing a bet or smth, that he passed out and they had to call an ambulance 💀💀), BUT CMON LA LIKE IT'S SO FUNNY THAT HE WAS SAYING GIRLS SHDNT FEEL OUT OF PLACE BCS THEY CAN BOND WT GUYS OVER ALCOHOL-😭😭😭✋🏻✋🏻 WE WERE ALL LAUGHING 😭😭 tbh i dont think hes entirely wrong bcs yea drinking is a huge part of their culture but it's just a rlly goofy argument 😭😭 uhmmm yea and then the conversation went on for a while and ania kept positing very solid arguments for egmo to exist 💯💯💯 then ig this guy cam malas or like mengalah, so at some point he was like "wait im not against egmo" AND WE WERE LIKE BRO???? THE REASON ALL DIS STARTED WAS CUZ U SAID U WERE AGAINST IT SJDASHDSAJDHAJ 😑😑 also tbh i think being against egmo is valid, it's just that his reasoning/arguments were... floppy 🫤

  <summary><b>concerning disappearance:</b> mira gone missing</summary>

haiya basically ah, at the mbl hike ah, we took a short break then we continued hiking, but then sofia noticed miRRRa was MISSING. (ngl it's lowkey expected someone will get missing at some point when u're hiking with like 40 kids LMAO.) so we told the organisers and there was lots of drama bcs the organisers were basically calling each other to ask abt mira, but no one saw any sign of him bruh 🥶🥶🥶. also keep in mind that while all this was happening, the rest of us kids had to stop at the trail we were hiking at to wait, so it wasnt even a convenient waiting place or anything. ppl tried texting and calling too i think but there was no reception or IDK?? yea wtv then we just waited and waited and organisers were busy being responsible and stuff, AND EVENTUALLY THEY FOUND HIM YAYYYY. i dont actually know how they found him but uhh yea!! anyway take a wild guess where/why he went missing - if u said bcs he went on the wrong trail and got lost, u're very very wrong!! it's bcs this guy went off, ON HIS OWN, WITHOUT INFORMING ANYONE, to the peak of the hike (which is where we were gonna go anyway) using a diff route (presumably a steeper shortcut) 🤡🤡🤡 AND WHEN WE SAW HIM AGAIN HE WAS SO CHILL ABT IT TOO 😭😭 i was like "MIRA WHERED U GO" and he would answer so joyfully and carefree, like does bro not understand that he caused a grp of 40+ ppl to wait and worry??? 😑😑😭😭

  <summary><b>all-nighter:</b> who needs sleep anyway?? 🥱🤷🏻‍♀️</summary>
<ul>
  <li> <b>✨the future is in the now✨:</b> basically om was wearing a shirt that said "the future is in the now" AND OMG I SWEAR MY HUMOUR IS SO BROKEN BUT CMON THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING EVER LIKE I CDNT STOP LAUGHING 😭😭😭 (ye ye it's not that funny pun)</li>
  <li> <b>letters 💌:</b> i started the night by writing letters with karlo, mira, and some other ppl. (context: owen had this idea where we set up a board with envelopes so we can write letters and put them into the respective envelopes. when the participant/tutor has to leave, theyll rip it off and take the letters home with them. its a BRILLIANT and rlly sweet idea. 🥹🥹) so karlo was pouring his heart out into every single one, i was getting thru each in a reasonable amt of time, some of the others just wrote rlly short notes to ppl, and MIRA WAS JUST SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO WRITE AHAHAHA. so we had to teach/guide him and it was rlly funny cuz he was visibly struggling the whole time (i even referenced it in my letter to him) 🤡🤡🤡 i think i wrote like 15-ish letters, karlo wrote like so many (i forgot but mybe 35 if i had to guess??), and mira wrote like 3 i think, WHICH IS BETTER THAN ZERO!! 🎉🎉 anyway i received a bunch of rlllyyyy sweet letters which i only read when i got back (i compiled them into a pdf!!) and mira happened to write one to me too!! i must say, he actually did pretty good and im super proud - the letter was definitely very nice and i rlly appreciate his efforts 😌😌💗 but mira if u're reading this, PLS FIX UR HANDWRITING DUDE 😐😐😐💀💀</li>
  <li> <b>just dance 🕺🏻:</b> we had a just dance session for a while but i feel like a lot of the songs were mid HAHAH so i only joined for like 2 songs or smth :D</li>
  <li> <b>tea (literal and metaphorical) ☕:</b> the night bef the all-nighter, i saw our untouched tea bags in our room, sooo i had the genius idea of DRINKING TEA during the all-nighter (yes im so smart ik ik) 💡💡‼️ so we (me, karlo, mira, artur, then mano and krzys came along) went to karlo's room to make TEAAAA. then we (+our cups and kettle) went to this rlly cosy rip-off wooden room (mbl reference) in the hotel (which was actually off-limits but karlo sweet-talked the guy with his impressive bosnian skills ✨) and we DRANK tea while SPILLING tea HAHAHAHA 😭😭🤡🤡🤡 okay eventually we got kicked out tho lmao but it was totally fun while it lasted 🥹🥹🫶🏻</li>
  <li> <b>chillin ❄️:</b> after tea, we went back to the main building to just chill and hang out (also om wasnt there anymore 👎🏻), BUT OMG eventually this old man entered the room (owner of the resort mybe?) AND IT WAS SO SCARY cuz he was speaking to damian or rastko i think, and he was speaking bosnian right so obv i cdnt understand but u can TELLLL he was mad, but funny thing is that he was like SCREAMING BUT WHISPERING AT THE SAME TIME?? SHDJDJFNG IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN IT 💀💀 so we kinda just observed and karlo was translating some stuff for us. apparently the guy was getting mad cuz uhh the building was messy ig and he was like "WHO GON CLEAN UP THIS MESS 🤬😇🤬😇" (imagine him saying that while screaming but whispering) and also ig cuzzz uhhh we were blasting music but idt u can hear it from outside the building but IDK. yea then after that whole thing WE GOT KICKED OUTTTT UGHHHSJDJDJT (that's twice in one night!!) 🙄🙄🙄 then we agreed to go to alessandro's room AND WE SWITCHED ON THE TVVV!! (for the first time thru out camp) 🤯🤯 i also drank coffee which ahmet made even tho i basically never drink coffee (i figured i'd probably need it) :P. and then we just hung out and talked until eventually the sun rose and ppl starting leaving so we had to say our goodbyes 🤧</li>

  <summary><b>uncovered:</b> mira's mystery song 🔍</summary>

during the last few days at camp, mira kept whistling this one song (on walks, etc.) and he was saying he cant rmbr the name of the song but it was stuck in his head. also, i nvr rlly bothered to listen to him whistling (even tho he was whistling ALL THE TIME 💀) bcs idk why but i had the impression that it wasnt an english song to begin with. (im pretty sure at some point on the walk or smth, he tried searching up the song on his phone but he was searching up non-eng songs?) FAST FORWARD to the all-nighter when we were hanging out in alessandro's room, we were reflecting on mblb, and mira and i were saying mblb was like less ✨musical✨ than mbl. then i was mentioning some songs and ofc i cant forget to mention iris bcs that song is LITERALLY mbl 🥹💔 and i mmg like that song since before pun but mbl gave it meaning/significance to me so it has a vry special place in my heart now 🥺🥺 pastu mira was like "what song is that? lemme search it up" (okay u can probably already guess the ending here) so then he played it on his phone and mira was like "THIS IS THE SONG IVE BEEN WHISTLINGGGGG" HAHAHA 😭😭😭 kinda crazy how that song was stuck in his head thru out camp and he only figured out the name of the song during THE LAST FEW HOURS at camp 😭😭 then we all sat there and listened to it, such a good song 🥹🥹🫶🏻

  <li> <b>trio 🃏:</b> my new fav card game!! only issue is that i feel like experience makes u worse 🤓☝️also when we introduced the game to mira, he kept winning again and again so we decided to kinda team up against him AND HE STILL WON BRUH. ALSO HIS MEMORY IS HORRIBLE BUT SOMEHOW HE WAS WINNING SO OFTEN 😤👎🏻</li>

  <li><b>stone skipping 🪨:</b> dr syafiq took me + mustafa + mira + om to some supposed tourist site but when we arrived it seemed like it was closed?? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ and felt like we were trespassing on private property lol idk. then on the way back, we stopped by the river and started skipping stones, but eventually we just started chucking large rocks into the river :/</li>

### (2) mbl-b vs mbl
now obviously i enjoyed both, but we (i.e. ppl who went to mbl) agree that mbl was kiiiinda better. mblb's venue is like super premium tho!! 🤩🤩 basically the best resort in bosnia?? and we got to stay in rllyyy nice apartments - each apartment even had like a living room wt a tv, and also a kitchen. NOT TO MENTION, the food is omg AMAZING 🤌🏻🤌🏻 (especially when compared to mbl la hehe, we had sm potato~). good variety, plus got deserts every meal, and also the great thing is that everything is halal so i wasnt meat-deprived 😎🔥🤘🏻 but even tho the venue was great, i lowkey liked the mbl venue more bcs it's a lot more cosy and compact. like mblb's common areas have very hotel vibes (i mean it IS a hotel ig), while mbl feels more like home (mybe also cuz we had the entire venue to ourselves). likee compare the main building's lobby vs the wooden room 🥶🥶 and also, i kinda didnt like that all the stuff going on is in a separate building from where we stay. like at mbl, most events happen downstairs while our rooms are just right upstairs 🤷🏻‍♀️ oh and another thing, mbl was a lot more musical than mblb. at mbl, many of the organisers had guitars so it was a common thing to have sing-alongs at night ⚡⚡ meanwhile at mblb, even the karaoke felt off 🫤 the closest we got to nice music vibes at mblb was grp-singing bohemian rhapsody at the hike while waiting for the organisers to find a lost grp of ppl HAHAHAH (but then that grp of ppl ended up going elsewhere by themselves 🤡) and mbl stash was better hehe (sofia received a shirt from last year HAHAHAHAAH). ~~also there was a lot more drama happening at mbl buuuut... mybe i just missed out on all the drama at mblb?~~

### (3) courses i attended
- **folding + train tracks:** I LOVE GABRIEL. his class was one of the easiest to follow. first we did group theory stuff, and he showed us how we can interpret words as graphs, then we looked at stallings theorem, which is like applying a bunch of folds then an immersion on graphs :0 (i shd revisit this)
- **probabilistic programming:** very funnn + chilll, and kalina is rlly cool + funny. she convinced us that probabilistic programming is gonna outperform ML 🤯👀 (and patrik tried to debate it i think but he was bringing up rlly irrelevant stuff HAHAH.) im rlly interested to learn it cuz it seems so awesome to be able to program ur own models, so karlo + ahmet + i made a pact to work on models tgt 🤩 we've been busy so we hvnt rlly started anything yet but we do have some super dope ideas 😌
- **worming out of the forest:** i only went for the first day bcs i realised i would rather learn new concepts or smth instead of studying progress on an open problem (especially since i can just read the paper myself). but essentially the problem is like: u're lost in a forest, what's the optimal path to get out? so on the first day he just showed a specific case 
- **dirichlet's got character:** more grp theory stuff. i feel like i was pretty lost a lot of the time ☹️☹️ like for a lot of parts i understood the math for the most part, but i had no idea what we were doing and i'd just keep following the math hoping that it'd click at the end, but nope i was left confused a lot 😭😭
- **topology:** i rlly enjoyed this one and i swear im not being biased 🤓☝🏻 i can say for sure that this was the class i gained the most out of. everything was so well-structured and easy to follow 💯💯 honestly made me realise that structure is a rlly important aspect in learning/teaching. but we basically skipped over all the formal stuff (which is what theyd do in uni) but i learnt a lot and its great intuition for topology. ~~last years topology course was too formal for my taste.~~ the stuff we did was a lot more visual and we proved a rlly awesome fact, which is that any closed connected topological surface is homeomorphic to either S, T_k or N_k WHICH IS SUCH A COOL RESULT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVE IN 3 DAYS. oh and another thing that surprised me was that the connected sum of two projective planes is homeomorphic to the FRICKIN KLEIN BOTTLE 💥💥🤯 anyway i feel like all mbl courses shd be like this where it's less formal but aims to give u a good intuition for the subject (so u can also decide if u're interested in further studying it or not)
- **intro to logic:** so i went for this one bcs i enjoyed carlos's course last year (automata theory) but i was rllyyyy sleepy the first day which is one of the reasons i only went for one day (and also cuz uliana kinda convinced me to go for hers). but one new thing i learnt abt was logic trees. i think the topic isnt rlly for me tho
- **electromagnetism:** during TAU of day 1 block 2, uliana crashcoursed us AND IT WAS FUN CUZ I WAS UNDERSTANDING IT LOL. (one of the reasons i was hesitant to go was cuz i thought it was calculus-heavy.) and uliana is rlly fun and super duper enthusiastic (shes basically never not smiling) and full of energy and she talks rlly fast and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT. LIKE CAN WE NORMALISE SPEAKING AT THAT PACE bcs when ppl speak too slow i start zoning out 😭😭😭 yeap so that convinced me to go for hers on day 2 HAHA. then i missed day 3 but she crashcoursed us later. we covered the maxwell equations!! also she made me understand partial derivates almost instantly
- **nt sledgehammers:** i feel like i wdve rlly enjoyed this course (judging by the material) but i only went for day 3 which was vry vry different from day 1 + 2. it wasnt any serious math, he kinda just showed us some cool math easter eggs e.g. "almost true" equations in the simpsons lmao, and examples where a long-lasting pattern breaks. some ppl loved it but some haaated it bcs well yea it wasnt real math lol 🙃
- **quantum computing:** rushil is a vry enthusiastic and chill guy (who also evidently likes playing all kinds of games). first day was like "hmm so far so good" (even tho i definitely did find this stuff confusing). he just talked abt it without going into much math, like by showing us the beam-splitter thing and basically trying to convince us that all of this was intuitive ~~even tho it's not~~. but UHH by the second day, i was zoning out pretty bad 😬 and by the third day, i just attended to secure my perfect attendance record (i was playing parks cantica on my phone) SJDHSAJ sorry rushil~ 💀💀💀

---

we didnt hv mbl-b chronicles but till has like 20hrs of footage (that must be A LOT to edit) so im looking forward to his movie soon 🤩💥urgh anyway looks like i cant go for mbl poland this year since im already starting uni 🥲 but i promise i WILL come back to mbl camps someday, whether as a tutor or organiser or guest or wtv 🥺🥺
