  <summary><b>thieves in training:</b> learning the dark arts of pickpocketing 🥷🏻</summary>

we were walking in sarajevo and the tour guide guy told us to make sure we take good care of our belongings, or else stuff could get stolen 🫣🫣 and then like the morbidly curious person i am, i started expressing my fascination in the masterminds behind crimes 🤓☝️no bcs like srsly think abt it, the most successful criminals hv got to be legitimate geniuses to figure out how to pull off such crimes. and im genuinely so interested in what goes on in their minds and HOW they do it. anyway i guess milly was mildly concerned for me (i dont blame her - there r many things wrong wt me 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️), but we started talking specifically abt pickpocketing and techniques ykyk. then at some point we were pickpocketing milly's watch (which straps on rlly funky-ly and is so anti-pickpocket ngl) and we got a rlly goofy pic which i was gonna insert here but i got too lazy so meh. then we started practicing it on each other AND IM SO MAD BCS THEY ACTUALLY GOT ME LIKE TWICE??? 😭😭😭 milly was distracting me wt a handout and told me she was gonna show me smth, but they TOOK MY PHONE from underneath and i didnt notice, LIKE BRO IM SO EMBARRASSED THAT DUMB TACTIC WORKED ON ME 💀💀 and then there was another time milly took my phone which i left on the table, and i knew but she didnt know i knew 😏 then while we were at dinner i realised i needed my phone to fill out the feedback form, then i just put out my hand in front of milly and she was like "awh u knew? :(" SO IM PROUD I DIDNT FALL FOR THAT ONE 😌😌☝️

  <summary><b>IRKO:</b> the best olympiad 🏆</summary>

milly had to leave 2 days early and we like going on walks, so a day before she left, milly, artur, mira and i walked around konjic. then mira (?) found a viewpoint on gmaps so yaa after he did some convincing, we went up there which didnt take long (i wdnt even rlly consider it a hike). and then we just chilled there and enjoyed the view and it was rlly nice 🥺🥺 and also, while i was up there, i realised like "heh we're probably going here again for the mblb hike" (spoiler: i was right). AND THEN. IDK WHO. BUT SOMEONE STARTED KICKING ROCKS OFF THE PLATFORM. 🤡🤡🤡 AND THEN WE ALL JUST STARTED DOING IT AGAHAHSHSNFNGN. mira collected a bunch of small pebbles, tossed them onto the platform, AND THEN WE'D LAUNCH THEM AWAYYYYYY 🌠🌠 IT'S WAY MORE FUN THAN IT SOUNDS LOL. then i guess milly pulled out her phone and starting recording, and er yea i hv NO IDEA how it happened BUT SUDDENLY THE INTERNATIONAL ROCK KICKING OLYMPIAD (IRKO) WAS FORMED!!!! so it was me, mira and artur against each other, and milly was like the sports commentator interviewing us and all. apparently, ✨according to me✨, i'm from mars and the rock i kicked off was a martian rock, which is kinda why i was destined to do the best cuz martian rocks r way better than eArTh rOcKs yk wat im sayin 🥱🥱 so anyway i so obviously WON the irko but idk the other two kept insisting they did better??? but like im the bigger person here so i just let them dream on even tho ik im better, get what im sayin?? so humble of me 🥰🥰🙏🙏 okay then we got back and AHAHA krzys was in the lobby so we decided to troll him and we were like "ayo we just got back from the irko" "u've nvr heard of the irko??" "yea it's held in bosnia this year" "wait what, does ur country not take part??" AND HE LOOKED SO CONFUSEEDDDDD OMG HAHAHAHA, i lowkey feel bad 😭😭😭 but i guess eventually he figured we were trolling, then we told him what irko rlly was 🙃🙃

  <summary><b>avalon:</b> unfulfilled promises?? 😱</summary>

first of all i needa gv some context abt this patrik dude. HE IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PPL I'LL EVER MEET 😭😭😭 idek if i mean that in a good way or bad way cuz i feel like half the time ppl are laughing AT him not WITH him 💀💀 so basically this dude, likes to overcomplicate EVERYTHING. he just says/does rlly stupid stuff and it's rlly funny. also he swapped nametags with ziga at the beginning of camp, and convinced a fair amt of ppl that he was ziga and ziga was patrik 🤡💀 AND I KNEW HIS NAME WAS PATRIK but ngl even i was confused bruh 😒 also i shared the probabilistic programming class wt him and sometimes he would just say super random/irrelevant things in class and IDK just OVERCOMPLICATE EVERYTHING IN GENERAL??? idk how to explain patrik tbh, he's just his own kinda breed 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ anyway this dude LOVES avalon okay. (after the camp, he sent a msg in the grp chat saying to the organisers "next time pls dont make TAU at the same time we play avalon" AHAHAHAHAHSJDJDNG 😭😭😭). so there was a night i was in the lobby and he was looking for ppl to play avalon, but i said smth along the lines of "nah not now, but i hope to play at some point during the camp." and i don't recall ever **PROMISING** him i'd play avalon BUT OH WELL APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO HIM I DID!!! (i didnt, believe me guys 😑) so sometimes he'd see me and ask me to play avalon cuz i "promised" but i always had some excuse (i mean like, had other stuff i wanted to do la). BUT ON THE SECOND LAST NIGHT OR SMTH, I ACTUALLY DID FULFILL MY PROMISE AND PLAYED LIKE 3 GAMES OF AVALON. AND LIKE, I TOLD HIM I'D BE PLAYING. BUT HERE'S THE THING. HE DIDNT JOIN 💀💀💀 but wtv la i still fulfilled my promise so that's what matters. and then at some point he passed by us, so i called him out and was like "yo patrik, look im finally playing avalon, r u proud of me? 😌" and im pretty sure he just responded with a thumbs up LMAO. fast forward to our last night, i decided to write him a short note which said (and i quote) "yo patrik (or ziga, or whatever u wanna be), sorry it took me so long to play avalon LMAO - leia :')" HDSJDHASJ (yea i was gonna insert the pic here but then got too lazy). AND THEN AFTER THE CAMP HE TEXTED ME SAYING "you still owe me an avalon game" "you didnt play with me so it doesn't count" BUT BROOOO NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABT IT HVING TO BE WT HIM??? 😑😑😑 then i was like "i believe you owe me a trio game as well" CUZ YEA IM PRETTY SURE HE DOES. so u see at least i put effort into keeping my promise unlike patrik 😒😒

  <summary><b>waltz:</b> the return of the twirl 🌪️</summary>

so milly and i were at the waltz EA and we wanted to recreate THE twirl (iykyk) (cant be as perfect tho), but AAAA IM STUPID AND I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I... UHHH... KINDA... FORGOT... HOW TO DO ITTTTT 😭😭😭 LIKE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY IM SOO MAD AT MYSELF AHAHAJSDHASJ, LIKE BRO HOW COULD I FORGETTTTTT???😭😭😭 so yea i tried to do it wt milly and we tried to figure it out (my brain was NOT cooking tho, like bruh i cdnt figure out what to do with my arms and all that), and the entire time i was like reassuring~~/gaslighting~~ myself that it's SOMEWHERE in my memory BUT UGHHH IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDDD 🤬🤬😡😡. but NVM cuz i rmbr i hv the vid of me and maia doing the twirl from last year. BUT AGAIN, WHEN I TRIED TO FIND IT... IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDDDJWJDJF?? 😭😭😭 LIKE, IM PRETTY SURE I SAVED IT??? so UGHHHHHHHH then we had to try google/youtube it, but the stupid thing is that there are WAY too many frickin types of twirls, and so we cdnt find THE twirl ykwim 😑🙄🙄. and we had no damn clue what to search up for THE twirl (like, idk the name), so i was like AAAAHDSJHDAJ. and then the organiser running the EA saw that milly and i were on the phone so she came up to us and asked what we were doing, then we explained we were tryna do the twirl thing la and asked if she knew it, and she said she knew what we were talking abt but she didn't know how to do it 🥲🥲🥲 BUT THENNNNN ☝️☝️☝️ we rmbred that ines would hv the vid cuz it was in mbl chronicles!! 💡💡🧠🧠 we saw ines in the lobby and i feel kinda bad cuz i think she was in the middle of doing work, but we told her abt our ✨situation✨, then she fished out the mbl chronicles vid AND THE THING IS, IT'S LIKE 40 MINS LONG 💀💀 but thankfully we rmbred it's somewhere in the beginning so yea we just had to go thru the first few minutes AND EVENTUALLY WE FOUND IT YAAAAAYYYYY (ines is a lifesaver fr 🥹). then ines replayed that part of the vid so i could record it from my phone AHAHAHA 🤡🤡🤡 (also random but ines had a notebook with klcc on it, which she got from bosnia 🤯🤯) yea then after rewatching the vid a few times we figured it out, and other ppl started asking us how to do it, we were the coolest ones in the room fr 😎 ALSO ALSO IN MY DEFENSE, i actually did rmbr the starting position and what to do with my hands i guess, but the twirler's role is harder than the twirled's (like in reality maia was doing all the work, i just had to hold on to her) SO THAT'S WHY I DONT RMBR IT OKAYYYYY ☝🏻☝🏻💀💀💀

  <summary><b>karaoke❌communism✅:</b> an interesting night 😵‍💫</summary>

the karaoke last year was AMAZING (probably my fav EA) so i was rlly rlly looking forward to this karaoke, that i even became an emote (reminder to self: ask milly for the video) - i'd bang my fist on an invisible wall while cheerily announcing "KARAOKE NIIIGHTT!!" 😇😇😇 BUT GUESS WHATTT, IT WAS DISAPPOINTINGGGG 😭😭 LIKE THE VIBE WAS NOTTTT IT 😭😭 everyone was sitting down at the tables, and then for every song two ppl would stand in front and sing into the mic (i sang "smth just like this" wt om). also i think the vibe was off cuz the songs chosen were not the best karaoke songs (like some ppl chose vry not well-known songs). THERE WAS A RLLY CATCHY [GERMAN TRIG SONG](https://youtu.be/SCDtLk9IbSw?si=leLU2mJr641sCH7l) THO!! 🤓🤓 but anyway mira and i got bored so we left and milly happened to be hanging out at the cozy corner (right in front of the room we exited) so ofc we stopped there where at the couch across us, kalina and rastko were debating capitalism vs communism (!!) HAHAHAH. and their convo was rlly interesting so we just went quiet and tuned in, and their convo progressed and progressed and also damian joined in at some point (which made rastko mad at times) (adi was there too) and milly had stuff to do but the convo was rlly interesting so she ended up staying for way longer than she shdve HAHAHA 🤡🤡 then eventually the convo got chill, and isaak came along and kalina was playfully mocking his british accent and stuff 😌✨ also there was some stress ball rastko kept playing with and it broke at some point, and also when they threw it up to the ceiling itd get stuck there for a while before falling hahsjdjfjgy
