okay so it's time to go for the imo closing ceremony and we cdnt bring any bags in so i was gonna just bring my phone + huawei water bottle (from imo 22) and so i was gonna refill that bottle, and this is rlly embarrassing to admit but my weak arms cdnt fricking open it 💀💀 so i was like "ah well it's fine, i'll just bring the imo 24 bottle instead." and then i put in one of those cebion vitamin c tablets that fizzes in ur water and makes it orange bcs (1) my mum asked me to take them and ive been forgetting them thru out the entire trip so i needed to somehow finish as many tablets as i could asap 🤡🤡 and (2) many ppl were def gonna use that bottle as well, so the orange colour would distinguish my bottle from the rest (super big brain move and wjr approved btw 👍🏻👍🏻).

okay closing ceremony starts, everything's all good, i hold on to my bottle like the ENTIRE time (till it was time to take my medal - i just put it in front of my seat). and also, i vividly recall admiring the orange colour at random intervals thru out the ceremony (cuz the orange looked pretty cool in the green bottle :P). ALRIGHT BUT THEN. IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. I GRAB MY BOTTLE. I LOOK BACK AT IT. AND EH??? IT'S NOT ORANGE??? i asked the ppl sitting around me, checked under all the seats, and wjr even sent a msg in the big grp chat like "has anyone seen an imo bottle with a very **diSTiNcTiVe oRaNgE cOLoUr**?"

BUT NO ONE FRICKIN HAD IT. so well yea i mustve somehow swapped bottles with someone but (1) WHEN?? HOW?? and (2) MY WATER WAS ORANGE BRO - SO. DAMN. ORANGE. SO I MEAN- LOGICALLY- HOW COULD SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY TAKE MY BOTTLE THINKING IT WAS THEIRS DHASJDHASJDHASJ 😭😭😭 okay but wtv la, i just kept that bottle anyway hoping that someone else swapped with me and got to take back that bottle 🙃🙃

> #### so tldr 1, current mystery: how in the world did my bottle get swapped?? 🤔🔍

oh well, guess i could live without ever knowing that tho, so wtv... UNTIL..

RIGHT so im at mbl and AGAIN i had cebion tablets to finish up bcs i forgot before HAHAHAHAH 💀💀🤡🤡 so i took the plastic (disposable) bottle that i had (everyone had one but no one rlly used it), filled it with tap water, and dropped in the orange tablet so now my water is a glowing vibrant orange yayay. cool cool now at some point, i rmbr leaving that bottle at some side table, i thinkkk while i was doing origami?? (ONO help im starting to forget things.) but anyway, i eventually realised i didnt hv my bottle wt me and i left it somewhere (after all the night activities i.e. karaoke i think) so i go and search for it at that room and im thinking like "shd be easy to find cuz my water is orange" and so i go there and what do i see? yay a plastic bottle at the exact same table with the same level of water and the cap isnt fully disconnected (which was how i opened it). BUT GUESS WHAT?? THE WATER WASNT ORANGEEDHASJDHASKJDHKAS. 😭😭 and well, i dont see how it cdve been anyone else's bottle cuz (1) everything abt the bottle matched my bottle e.g. location and cap wasn't fully disconnected and (2) no one was using that plastic bottle tho so like... ??? but then... *this is ur cue to imagine a dramatic gif of neural connections lmao* DING DING DING. IT CLICKED. THE WATER JUST DECOLOURISES AFTER SOME TIME 🤯🤯💡💡 I SERIOUSLY HAD A LIGHT BULB MOMENT THERE AND I WAS IN PURE DISBELIEF FOR A FEW SECONDS HAHAHAHAHA. like- this changes **EVERYTHING**: the bottle (from imo) which i believed i STOLE (and felt guilty for it too) was actually MINEEEEEEEEEE OMGGGGGGGHDASJDHSAJ 😭😭 yea honestly rlly funny, and i ended up just leaving that bottle there tho (idk why lol, ig a part of me wasnt 100% convinced it was mine and it felt wrong taking it).

> #### HAHAHAH so tldr 2: mystery solved!! bottle was mine all along. the orange just decolourises after some time. 🥳🥳🎉🎉

yay end of story, right? SIKEEEE NOPE THERE'S MORE 💀💀

so im home hving dinner wt my family and im putting in one of those orange tablets into my water (i drink it every day when im at home but i drink it immediately, so i didnt know it decolourised), and it made me rmbr that incident at mbl so i shared it wt them (they knew what happened to my imo bottle so yea) and we all had a good laugh, but then ya know... we were just wondering... hmm how long would it take for the orange to decolourise?? so since i had some in my cup anyway, i left a little bit of it in there, just to see how long it would take till it lost its vibrant orange colour. fast forward to late night, i come to check on it and... it's still orange...?? uhhh okay that's strange, guess i'll just leave it for a bit longer?? 🙃🙃

CHECKED IN THE MORNING AND IT'S STILL ORANGE. at this point im baffled, stumped, dumbfounded, flummoxed, perplexed, befuddled (just throw in all synonyms of "confused" here, basically) but... okay nvm... NEW HYPOTHESIS!! mybe it decolourises when oxygen is eventually absent or smth?? (cuz both times it previously decolourised, it was in closed bottles.) (yea this hypothesis sounds rlly dum but wtv.) soooo i'll just transfer it into an airtight container then
<img src="/static/images/blogs/orange-container.jpg" alt="container" width="400"/>
BUT CHECKED AT NIGHT AND IT'S STILL BRIGHT ORANGE AAAAAAAAAAHDSJDHASJ. so what does this mean?? IT MEANS I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG. I'M STUPID AND THE ORANGE DOESN'T DECOLOURISE. (okay ik ur thinking like "uhmm u cdve googled that earlier 🤨🙄 " WELL YEA I KNOWWWWWW BUT IT SPOILS THE FUN HDASJHDSAJ LMAO).

> #### anyway TLDR 3: THE ORANGE DOESN'T DECOLOURISE. EVERYTHING IS EVEN MORE OF A MYSTERY THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE. WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOTTLE IN THE PREVIOUS 2 INCIDENTS??
