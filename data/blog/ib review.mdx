### (1) subject review

(hi this is me like 2 days later :P)

- **MAA (math) HL:** in terms of content, school math as expected je la ig. i hvnt rlly learned anything new, and there's not much i find that interesting idk. and i kinda hate myself cuz i've been totally slacking in MAA even since online class lagi UGHHHHH, like tak focus during class and tak buat homework AAHDSJDHAJ 😭😭😭 and like i genuinely do feel quite bad abt my behaviour towards MAA (idk it's just hard to paksa diri to listen and do stuff u already know how to do, when u know there r better things u could be doing? like i used maa classes to work on my mit app ☹️☹️) so the other day i wrote a short apology msg to my teacher and told her i'd try to do better (e.g. in submitting homework) BUT TBH I DIDNT RLLY DO BETTER AFTER THAT SO LIKE AAA IM SO SORRY TEACHER 😭😭 AND ALSO OUR TEACHER IS RLLY NICE SO I RLLY DO GENUINELY FEEL QUITE BAD FOR BEING THE WAY I AM 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 okay but besides that right, paper 1 is 🥰🥰🥰 BUT PAPER 2 IS 🤬🤬. paper 1 is no calculator (and i dont like numbers so yea u can guess why im okay with paper 1) but then paper 2 kena guna gdc (graphic display calculator) AND LEGIT A PART OF ME HATES THAT THING. like as a normal calculator, i feel like its so much slower than just using a scientific calculator, and then that calculator boleh graph stuff tau which is kinda stupid cuz u can kill so many problems by just drawing the graph or smth like AAAAHDAJDHSJA and i kid u not, if u wanna use ur gdc kan, in ur workings u just write "by gdc, *insert answer",  AND THEN IT'S WORTH LIKE 6 MARKS, CAM APA FUNCTION WEH?? UGH 😭😭 honestly bila fikir balik idk why im so against it 🤔 but ig it's just bcs i generally prefer non-calculator math in general. ok actually yk what there's nothing wrong with the gdc i think im just being a bit petty la HAHAHAH. yay self-reflection??? 💀💀😭 meh i think eventually i'll come to terms with that thing

- **physics HL:** WOW okay ngl at first i thought it was rlly boring and lowkey stupid, bcs we started off with learning abt uncertainty and sf rules which idk r rlly annoying to me and they just make ur life more complicated (and btw IB is so petty abt that stuff apparently 🙄🙄), and also the way we round off things is RLLY DUMB and triggers me sm AHAHAH. like yk the joke abt how engineers take pi=3, cuz fr we kinda do that now 😭😭🤬🤬 BUT THENNNN ☝🏻☝🏻 ngl it progressively got more interesting once we actually started learning content and crazily enough I THINK IM ENJOYING PHYSICS WOWOW. which is a bit surprising (ok no not surprising, but just a change ig) bcs spm physics nvr rlly piqued my interest (and i get why) but now that im ACTUALLY beginning to learn like PHYSICS physics, like yea i can say it's actually pretty interesting and fun to me, and def my fav subject now. it may also just be bcs among my 3 STEM subjects, physics is the only subject that im actually learning new stuff so idk HAHAHAH. there's some stuff yg i did learn a bit in permata (like torque), but i can say for sure that ib physics is much more in depth la compared to what we learnt in permata which was just surface-level je. physics still gives me a headache but yea at least im enjoying it 🔥🔥🔥 and our teacher's pretty cool too, and i think she thinks im good at physics or smth bcs she was chasing me to join OFM the other day (i tak join la cuz it was the weekend bef exam and im not that good at physics anyway), and like even an hour before the registration deadline she texted me again like "it's still not too late yk 🙂" HAHAHAH 💗💗

- **eng HL:** uhhhhh uhhh UHHH. idk what to cerita bcs like, it's english HAHAHAH. classes are just like random stuff we do/talk abt but kena do in english la. OH HA NVM I KNOW WHAT I CAN TALK ABOUT: LISTENING TEST. 💀💀 it's SOOOOO damn long eh like the reading/checking time and what not. like u get 5 mins reading time to begin with, then u get an additional 4 mins reading time for each question, then after each audio plays u hv an additional 2 mins, pastu after habis we had like an additional 10 mins bruh. LIKE WHAT CAN WE EVEN DO DURING THAT 10 MINUTES??? it's not like the audio is even gonna play again, it's just extra time for us to overthink and doubt our answers 😭😭 oh and then also the marking scheme is rlly weird and specific for the reading test, so cam susah la nak score. and also i think i didnt do well in my exams URM 😓😓😓 (my literacy skills r still disappointing oof)

- **chem SL:** like everything i learnt pernah belajar in permata HAHAHAH 🤡🤡 OKAY BUT THEN THE EXAM WAS RLLY RLLY UNSATISFYING (and i think i did pretty bad) bcs the questions yg keluar were like: 🤬🤬🙄🙄😒😒. like for example right, the entire electron configuration topic, KELUAR SATU JE SOALAN OBJECTIVE CAM AAAAADHSJDHAJ 😭😭 pastu ada soalan yg random gilaaaaaaa cam not even that related with apa yg kita belajar URGH. pastu one of the questions was ib past paper 3 question WHICH I COMPLETELY BUTCHERED WEH 🥹🥹🥲 also my teacher gives off very dr ain vibes GAHAHAH, like even first day class i was like OMG the tone and voice and everything cam dr ain HEHEHDJASHDAJ 🙃🙃 but shes vry nice and layan my stupid stupid questions. oh ya and that's the thing abt chem right, i realised i kinda just can't do it (like, as a profession or smth) bcs it's too... idk there r many things abt chem that i cannot puas hati HAHAHA. man idk how to explain it but for example kalau compare with math right, math is based off the system we invented so everything is "concrete" and "know-able" in that sense. but chem (and physics too) is dealing with real life stuff, which involves many "theoretical" or "hypothetical" aspects of it and idk there r many things abt it that just doesnt entirely satisfy me if that even makes any sense 🥲🥲 okay and i think i've kinda officially decided that im just not that into chem. (honestly if i could, i'd take bio instead of chem tapi subject combo tak membenarkan so ya 😒😒)

- **digital society SL:** (heads up, the 😭 emoji is so overused here.) AHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA 😭😭😭😭 WHY MUST I TAKE THIS SUBJECT OH MY GODDDDDDDDD 😭😭😭 like thing is right, the content is actually fine and totally relevant with my course. e.g. we learn abt components of the computer la etc. etc. TAPIIII at the end of the day, it's still a humanities subject yg kena tulis essay and all dat AND ALSO SUSAH GILA NAK SCOREEEEEE😭😭😭😭 like lemme tell u right, u basically hv to answer a bunch of essay questions (which r like about ethics and stuff, not essay questions based on content) but ngl it's plain stupid like LIKE LIKEEE- 😭😭😭 okay for paper 1, the essay question is 8 marks and paper 2 is 12 marks. and do yk how long the essays are? 10 paragraphs for paper 1 and 14 paragraphs for paper 2. and isi dia kena ikut format "PEEL" and what not. issue is, GILA TAK SEMPAT OKAY. like keep in mind on top of those essay questions, there r other questions to jwb as well. and yk during exam, my paper 2 essay, i only sempat write 8 (not well-written) paragraphs (so 6 points, which is half of what's required) sia, LIKE IM ACTUALLY SO FAILING DGS 😭😭😭😭😭😭 and senior pun kata 5 (out of 7) is lucky like BROOO HELPPP AAAA 💀💀💀 so yea dgs is probably my least fav subject, not bcs of the content but bcs of the nature of the subject itself + my grades r gonna take a huge hit cuz of dgs UGH 😭😭😭

- **malay SL:** okay sorry ik ik "anak msia ✨" and all that BUT FR WHY AM I TAKING THIS SUBJECT THO?!?! 💀💀 like first of all, hvnt i done enough malay? and i speak malay in sch anyway so...??? and the thing is, it's not even malay like what we learnt in spm, but literally malay SASTERA, and we hv to do analysis teks and all that. LIKE 👏🏻 FOR 👏🏻 WHAT??? 👏🏻😭😭😭 it's so irrelevant with my course + i hv 0 interest + no real world application for me UHM AAAAADHSJDHAJ 💀💀💀 (actually ngl i still prefer malay sastera over malay spm kut but STILL.) ALSO KAN OMG. okay we read cerpen khadijah hashim which is like not too bad, cam okay la, boring tapi ada la plot sikit. BUT THEN WE ALSO READ HATTA AZAD KHAN'S DRAMAS. no offense to the guy TAPI BORING GILA. there's like NO PLOT dude 😐. like the drama is actually so damn long but NOTHING HAPPENS. it's just a bunch of random scenes, but NOTHING 👏🏻 HAPPENS 👏🏻. like the last drama is the shortest one which is like 40+ pgs kut. and it's abt this guy who thinks the world is going to end WHICH WOW!! SOUNDS INTERESTING!! RIGHT?? NOPE. 😤😤basically he thinks the world is going to end then a bunch of RANDOM GILA events happen e.g. his daughter sibuk nak kahwin (okay ni sumpah lawak tho, fr the only entertaining aspect of the entire damn drama), his son sibuk nak produce a film, pastu the man bayar hutang la or wtv. pastu last2, keluar dekat news yg dunia tak kiamat. AND THAT'S IT. THERE'S LITERALLY ZERO PLOT SIA. 😭😭😭 and im talking abt that drama just cuz my grp was assigned that drama, and my part for the presentation was the elements of the plot tau (like exposition, climax, anti-climax, etc.) BUT THE PLOT WAS SO FRICKIN FLAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DECIDE CUZ THERE WAS NO DAMN CLIMAX OR ANYTHING AAAAAAAADHSAJDHSAJ 😭😭 i needa calm down now but ya every day i question why i hv to take this subject 🙃🙃🥰🥰

### (2) overall review of ib
dude idk what im doing like half the time like why in the world am i studying malay literature AAADHSJDHAJ NAK CRY 😭😭😭 honestly like i just rlly don't like the fact that i hv to do things that hv 0 relevance to me ☹️☹️ and idk i feel like ib is kinda a torturous program in general cuz it demands us to do so many things. like on top of studying 6 subjects, we hv all these things like TOK, CAS, EE, IA, etc and ngl the whole program is so unnecessarily complicated and payah la 💀💀 yea i honestly think i'd be much happier doing a-levels rn, or in fact any other pre-u program lol. (that being said tho i dont regret taking ib under ytp la cuz i still want undergrad scholarship with no bond so.) and actually now kan baru sem 1, which was actually pretty chill, and like HONESTLYYY im rlly not looking forward to the next sems AAAAAAA. cuz that's when stuff starts to get heavier + gotta worry abt ee and ia (which r basically rsrch projects). also i think ib is just not for me cuz i like doing a lot of things outside of school (like math oly etc.) and ib doesnt rlly accommodate it even tho they claim to do so with our CAS requirement or wtv. and on another note i think i did pretty darn bad in exams 🥹🥹🥲 like all my humanities (eng, malay, dgs) i tak sempat finish pun 😭😭

<details>
<summary>jap nak sidetrack sikit lmao</summary>
ok this is not a review of ib or anything but ive kinda become malas in my work. like, i basically dont hv any interest in the subjects im learning rn (besides physics a bit la), and im literally becoming such a disappointing student by my standards 😭😭 bnyk kerja tak buat, and kalau buat pun mostly cincai je. like yea idk what's happened to me but i just dont hv motivation to buat betul2 anymore especially cuz no interest ig 🥲🥲 and another reason also, i think i sort of have this underlying sense of resentment bcs i think a part of me feels like "i dont deserve to be stuck with ib as my only choice" which ikkk is a rlly bad mindset which i need to get rid of but yea it's like a part of me just mmg tak nak puas hati dgn hakikat tu, and TRULY accepting it is fr easier said than done UGH 😭😭😭 but yes my point is that im kinda becoming a bad student and the overachiever side of me is disappointed with myself but then the chill side of me is like "takpe ah" so idk what to do or what to feel anymore AAAAAHDSJAHDSAJ. basically cognitive dissonance at its finest ah 💀💀
</details>

anyway back to talking abt ib. i feel like if u already know ur interests, and ALSO if u hv a lot of self-initiative (e.g. in ECs, independent rsrch, etc.), tak yah do nak buat ib, menyusahkan je. the program intends to be "holistic" or wtv, which is why we hv requirements for languages and humanities and all that, but yea it means that u'll most likely hv to take subjects ur not interested in. literally more than half the subjects im taking now r humanities LIKE BRO??? ME?? HUMANITIES?? NAHHH 😭😭🤬🤬 and then we hv to do rsrch projects and exhibitions and all that which i mean yeaaa?? i might kinda enjoy?? but i think mostly i'll be super stressed bcs of how much it contributes to my grade ☹️☹️ and then we also hv this CAS thing which ENTAHLA no one has been taking it srsly (cuz baru sem 1 kut) so im not rlly too sure exactly how itll be like, but in summary we're required to collect 100 hours of "creativity, activity, service (CAS)" or smth laaa i oso dk. anyway, NOT looking forward to next sems!! 😇😇😇🥰🥰🫶🏻🫶🏻

### (3) overall review of kmb

(hi this is me like another 2 days later btw OOPS. it's almost 2am now and i gotta get up early tmr so ya i'll keep this short kut)

honestly it's fine? ppl r fine, food is fine, asrama is fine, everything is fine je idk dhdasjdhaj 🙃. i think i'll still forever prefer the ppl/environment in permata tho but ig that can't be changed. oh ya and i was talking to dr syafiq earlier ystd, and he said he thinks kmb is kinda oppressive which yea that's kinda true especially for a pre-u program (but i think similar to matriks kut). like we still hv a lot more rules and cannot go out and all that stuff (like mrsm, but longgar sikit ah), but i think it's cuz im from asrama anyway so that stuff just feels normal for me. OH the teachers here are pretty good tho but idk if it's just bcs im comparing to permata lecturers so like HAHAHAH 🤡🤡🤡 yo but one thing i dont rlly like is that i feel like a lot of the time i takde tempat nak pergi to study or do things. AND OUR MEJA DEKAT BILIK KECIK GILA SO I DONT LIKE LAHHH. 😒😒 (i miss the huge tables in permata omg.) okay so there's the library tapi weekends tak bukak (recently, at least). there's this place LC as well which ig isnt too bad but i pernah go there once je cuz my friend ajak but yea i might start going there more often? and there's always concourse TAPI SELALU PANASSS. hmm yea but i feel like i hvnt been in the school long enough to decide if i like the school or not. and uhhhh nothing that interesting has rlly happened to me yet in sch (every day feels the same), besides that one camp i went for and oh ya kena paksa apply mpp tapi tu cerita lain (i've been procrastinating my application stuff HELP 💀💀)

anyway i shd probably sleeeep so that's all i'll say for now. ~~hopefully im not stuck here much longer~~
