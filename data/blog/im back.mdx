a lot a lot has changed and i dont hv anything better to be doing now (jk i do but oh well) so i'll just dump everything here. also i absolutely do not hv the mental capacity to organise my thoughts rn so take what u get 🤷🏻‍♀️

SO ACETERUS IS FINALLY DONE, IM BACK TO PHYSICAL SCHOOL, AND MY MIT APP WAS OFFICIALLY COMPLETED YSTD (after some trouble submitting my rsrch supplement lmao) WHICH MEANS WOAH MY LIFE IS KINDA BACK TO NORMAL NOW??? YEA IT'S SO WEIRD LIKE, im normal again?? well obv not but at least normal by my standards 🙃

okay lemme talk abt mit app firstststst. so overall HMM, i think my app looks better this year and my essays were also better i think, and oh god i REALLLYYYY rlly hope it's successful cuz ngl i spent so much goddamn time on it and it DEF affected my IB so cam hrmhrmmmmdkasdasjk. oh ya and i had issues submitting my rsrch supplement cuz slideroom wdnt frickin lemme get past payment verification idk, so was lowkey panicking but nvm eventually paid with paypal and after emailing them (thrice) they said they'll accept the supplement so woohoo yes im free from all that stress now BUTTTTTTTTTT NGL IM KINDA SAD?? sad bcs the prospect of being accepted is like a huge glimmer of hope in my life, and i just feel helpless now cuz its over and so on my end, my fate is sealed and i cant do anything abt it now AND AAA THAT KINDA SUCKS ☹️☹️ anyway i gotta wait like over a month now which actually isnt that long but still im super impatient and waiting sucks and also imma just say it right here but if i dont get in (most probably) i think i'll be pretty miserable so yes if i cut off all form of communication in mid dec then THAT'S why 👍🏻👍🏻 realistically i dont think i shd be that hopeful tho weh cuz despite the previous waitlist (im hoping thisll pull me up) cam, i heard from someone there that they still nak pre-u lah EEEEEEEEE dahla my age might be an issue ughhhhhhjdashdjhasj but i hope they see HSD as rigorous enough or like, idk just smth (ANYTHING) to get me in DHASJDHSAJ okay enuf abt dat la, tanak fikir dah (oso idk if im applying regular tapi cam tak je)

okay next topic - baru masuk kmb woo wow so fun i love itt amazinggg HMPH 😐😐 actually okay je la senanya tapi sumpah cam tak process lagi cuz was so busy wt other stuff the past 2 weeks. BUT IM GONNA BE A NORMAL STUDENT AGAIN EEEEEEEHDASJDHSAJ 💀💀 schs boring la ngl but ig now i can finally start betul2 experiencing it brrrr 🥶🥶 also actually bnyk benda tak suka but i'll keep that to myself la hehe 😇 DAHLA malas la fikir pasal sekolah ew

MATH MATH MATH. okay bro like, i rlly wanna get back to math, and im contemplating to WHAT EXTENT i wanna get back to math. cuz ngl weh mmg if i get back to it my IB will ZOOPPPPP 📉📉 TAPI AAAAAAHDSJDHAJ idk la how much time i wanna devote to it 🫤 cuz i STILL wanna do it but fr i'll actually become such a bad student

uh ha pastu back on the topic of being a normal student again, okay ngl i rlly needa get back on track and start studying cuz i dowanna fail yay and also mybe tmr i wanna start running again also CAS is kinda stupid also my brain is so lazy to think abt sch and i kinda just wanna do what i want so yes i suck its stupid and AAAAAHSJDJJF actually a lot of things happened but im just so lazy to think abt it HAHAHAH oh ya also im gonna get braces soon or smth uhhh

mm also ive been hving a lot of deep thoughts lately so mybe i'll dump later when i feel like it (or when they're resolved), but OMG nak rant sikit la i dont like how ppl dont fricking THINK and ppl like to trivialise everything like UGHHHSJEJJT why r ppl so not open to questioning things and stuff like that i just I JUST 😡😡😭😭

okok dahla imma vibe to music while continuing to drown myself in those deep thoughts in hopes of eventually falling asleep BYE BYE
